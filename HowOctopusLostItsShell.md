"[How the Octopus Lost its Shell](https://ssjulian.com/comics/how-the-octopus-lost-its-shell)" (2023) by Danna Staaf & S.S. Julian (Sam Santos Julian), self-published zine.

This (12-page, with front & rear covers) comic zine is an adorable, concise history of the evolution of cephalopods & octopi. You'll definitely want to check out the artwork & illustrative... illustration. But the artists describe the project better themselves...

"When we describe them with these words, are we projecting an image of ourselves, or are we recognizing the universality of features once considered the sole domain of humans?

In the following pages, we make no attempt to answer such philosophical questions. Instead, we present the history of how octopuses evolved, providing a factual context in which to continue wondering. All of the information in *How the Octopus Lost Its Shell* is based on peer-reviewed scientific research, and is true to the best of our knowledge in 2023."
