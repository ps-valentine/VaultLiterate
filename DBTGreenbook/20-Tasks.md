## Distract with Tasks and Chores (p. 20-21)
Strangely, many people don't schedule enough time to take care of themselves or their living environments. As a result, tasks and chores go uncompleted. Here, then, is the perfect opportunity to do something to take care of yourself and your environment. The next time you're in a situation in which your emotions become too painful, temporarily distract yurself by engaging in one fo the following activities. Check the ones you're willing to do, and then add any activities that you can think of:
- [ ] Wash the dishes.
- [ ] Make phone calls to people you haven't spoken to recently, but not someone you're angry with.
- [ ] Clean your room or house, or go help a friend with their cleaning or gardening project.
- [ ] Clean out your closet and donate your old clothes.
- [ ] Redecorate a room or at least the walls.
- [ ] Organize your books, collectibles, desktop, etc.
- [ ] Make a plan for getting a job if you don't already have one, or make a plan for finding a better job.
- [ ] Go get a haircut.
- [ ] Go get a manicure or pedicure, or both.
- [ ] Go get a massage.
- [ ] Wash your or someone else's car.

Here's an example of using tasks and chores to distract yourself. Mike called his girlfriend Michelle to go to a movie. Michelle had already made plans with her friends to do something else. Mike felt incredibly rejected and abandoned. He started yelling at Michelle, who hung up on him. This made Mike feel worse. He didn't know what to do. Quickly, he began to feel light-headed and confused, and his emotions became very angry. But this time, instead of calling Michelle back and arguing, he opened his wallet and pulled out the distraction plan he had made (which you'll also create at the end of this chapter). He had written down "get a haircut," so he walked a half mile to his barber. Getting out of his house helped soothe his anger, and when he returned home, he had cooled down enough to call Michelle back to see if she was busy the next day.
