# Introduction: TILIFI
- "For more than fifty years, Miss Major has played the crucial role of surrogate mother and grandmother to countless trans and queer people around the world." (1)
- "Major has surpassed the expectations of those she calls **'The Powers That Be'**: the corporate, government, and nonprofit actors who work to preserve the status quo, and the forces in the world who want us all to fit into our proper places in an established social hierarchy, from which they can look down on us and make sure we don't fuck with the money and privilege they hoard." (1)
- "Major's driver's license lists her date of birth as October 25, 1946. Her parents raised her and her two siblings, Cookie and Sargeant, off the salaries of a United States Postal Service administrator and a beauty shop manager during the few years when a Black middle class began to grow in cities like Chicago. There, she graduated high school at sixteen, and her family paid to send her to college in Minnesota... In the dorms she was placed with a roommate who couldn't keep a secret, and after he discovered her suitcase of femme clothing, she left school before the first term was over." (2)
- "Once a month, she trekked three hours up to Riverview, an amusement park on the North Side where she bought hormones from a dealer who held office hours under a rickety wooden roller coaster." (2)
- "Major hadn't even turned twenty when her mother declared that Chicago wasn't big enough for the two of them, so she and a friend stole a car and took off in the direction of New York City. They were so eager to leave that a cop pulled them over for speeding before they had made it past the city limits; Major wound up in jail for six months..." (2)
- "...But she'd come to New York to perform, not to paint.
  
  The Apollo Theater had an established drag show called the Jewel Box Revue, which Major had first seen in Chicago during one of the group's cross-country tours. Its posters promised the 'Most Exciting Deception in the World,' starring 'twenty-five men and one girl.' During the weeklong run, Major had dressed 'in her stuff' and spent nights at the stage door until she met the stage manager and charmed her way onto the cast, taking on a backup role when one of the regular cast members fell ill. She rejoined the cast in New York." (3)
- "Trans women, especially Black trans women, still have few job options that offer a living wage. The stage shows at the Apollo didn't pay enough to survive, but sex work did, as Major learned from other performers. One night working the Avenues in Lower Manhattan paid the bills faster than the drag shows and the morgue combined. Major learned how to clock undercover cops and further refined her ability to sweat charm, gliding between the social groups that claimed territory on the Avenue and clients of all sorts." (3-4)
