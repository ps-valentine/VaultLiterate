### Chapter 2 Transfeminist ethics and practices of care
#### Landing in Trans Lives as They Are Lived
- "This chapter addresses **collective care** as a practice of interdependent survival and the forging of meaningful relations as a means toward liberation, while elaborating an ethics that emphasises solidarity and support, attentiveness and love. We understand that transfeminist care and ethics hold collective practices together that elaborate alternative worlds and ways of living. **This ethics entails the refusal of disposability and \[refusal of] devaluation of marginalised people that is encouraged within neoliberalism capitalism**, by focusing on how we are navigating and transforming the space left open by institutional neglect." (42-43)
- "By care, we are speaking of the work and activities that attend to the physical and emotional needs of all life; this includes the skills and capacity of 'nurturing... all that is necessary for the welfare and flourishing of life'." (43)
- "We find it useful to understand the *forms* care takes, for instance, mutual aid, therapy, care webs, emotional labour, social reproduction, or removing toxic environmental pollution, to look for different sorts of meaning that arise. Through these forms, we understand *practices* of car, for instance, getting groceries for another person who can't go to the shops, cooking, or vacuuming or washing dishes, making space for difficult emotions with a friend, sharing resources, sending love when love is needed, and challenges in transitioning with others. There is not always a clear line between forms and practices of care, but thinking through the distinction allows for an understanding of *how* (in what form do) we come together and give meaning to our actions; while practices speak of the concrete activities we undertake to mutually give and receive support from each other." (43)
- "Linked to this comes another side of care, which we call **attentiveness**. This entails knowing where your attention goes and how one is sharing their attention with the world... By identifying needs, desires, and patterns of thought one is aware of what care can give, which skills need to be learnt, but also what one needs to unlearn - for instance, not daring to ask for care. Nonnormative flourishing needs mutual attentiveness. We experience attentiveness as a necessary component of nurturing difference." (43-44)
- "We describe... the significant differences between structural harm... and accidental harm, but in all cases, harm calls for care as a reparative. Care supports dealing with the navigation of hostile social ecologies, whether they are institutional, social, or familial." (44)
- "Some harm is medical in nature, such as the forced sterilisations that have been endured; some harm does not come across as harm, for instance, in the everyday contestations that wear one down." (44)
- "While trans life is often displayed in narratives of harm, it is rarely shown as a form of flourishing. This is partly because contemporary neoliberal capitalism is not interested in flourishing, neither for trans life, nor for most other life. Care and attentiveness as forms of nurturing lead to flourishing - when they are not interrupted by duress." (45)
#### Hierarchies of Care
- "As Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha writes, the expectation to perform are is tied into how femmes, and especially poor and/or disabled and/or femmes of colour including sex workers, are valued in communities, which seemingly invites endless availability and work." (45)
- "It is not for nothing that... \[FINISH]" (45)
