#### **Notes on the List**
- Recommendations are listed in reverse-chronological order.
- If a book is included on more than one of Slingshot's annual lists, I only include the most recent mention (and they *do* repeat). For some years, I was using a mini-Slingshot planner. As I'm unsure whether those have different lists, I've noted (Mini) in the years title to indicate this difference.
- I've often included subtitles where the Slingshot Collective did not, presumably for space reasons. I'm a sucker for subtitles and we're not limited by space here!
- If I've noted "available online" next to a listing, that indicates that a.) I was having a difficult time sourcing a printed book and b.) that the listing appears to have been primarily (or initially) released online.
- I've identified university presses, as I understand these books can be more difficult to obtain for regular bookstores. I've also identified AK Press because I love them very much.
- The below listing isn't actually a book, it's a scientific article! Where possible, I will include information on the journal they came from; I've also stylized peer-reviewed/scientific articles differently, with "quotations" instead of *italics*.
	- "Conjunctural Mapping of People's Park" (2024) by Gregory Woolston & Katharyne Mitchell from *Annals of the American Association of Geographers*
- **2026-01-07:** I do plan to expand this list to include the recommendations from Slingshot planners from prior years!
- **2026-01-22:** the abovementioned project is proceeding at a pleasing rate.
