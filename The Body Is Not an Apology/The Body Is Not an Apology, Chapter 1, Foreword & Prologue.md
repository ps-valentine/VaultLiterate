# The Body Is Not an Apology
by Sonya Renee Taylor, 2018
### Foreword 

- "The concern that my mother and my aunt had for the size and shape of my body was the same concern that their mothers had for them when they were girls. It was born from the fear that the world would be cruel to me if my body was not an acceptable size or shape, as the world had been cruel to them. They could not imagine a world that would love any woman in a larger body, and they wanted me to be loved. Their concern came from love, and that love felt like a knife to the heart." (ix)
- "It was not until I was in my thirties that it occurred to me that perhaps I didn't want to spend the rest of my life fighting myself. Perhaps the victory that lay at the end of the long road of self-denial and repression was not a reward that I actually wanted. Perhaps all the love and acceptance that had been promised me if I could just hate myself into a new me didn't exist. Perhaps I was going to spend my entire life fighting my own existence and then just... die." (x)
- "Sonya envisions radical healing divorced from the ableist, capitalist White supremacy of traditional 'self-help.' She envisions healing not only for the elf but for our communities... I hope that in these pages you find your moment of living, truly living, in your body and mind. I hope that moment leads to a lifetime of living in self-love. We all deserve to live our lives as our full selves, in all of our true beauty." (xi)

### Prologue 

- "When we hear someone's truth and it strikes some deep part of our humanity, our own hidden shames, it can be easy to recoil into silence. We struggle to hold the truths of others because we have so rarely had the experience of having our own truths held... There are times when our unflinching honesty, vulnerability, and empathy will create a transformative portal, an opening to a completely new way of living." (xiv-xv)
- "She \[Marianna Williamson] posited, "An acorn does not have to say, 'I intend to become an oak tree.' Natural intelligence intends that every living thing become the highest form of itself and designs us accordingly."" (xv-xvi) 
    
- "Contrary to purpose, natural intelligence does not require we do anything to achieve it. Natural intelligence imbues us with all we need at this exact moment to manifest the highest form of ourselves, and we don't have to figure out how to get it. We arrived on this planet with this source material already present." (xvi) 
    
- "...tapping into this natural intelligence often feels nearly impossible. Humans unfortunately make being human exceptionally hard for each other, but I assure you, the work we have done or will do is not about acquiring some way of being that we currently lack. The work is to crumble the barriers of injustice and shame leveled against us so that we might access what we have always been, because we will, if unobstructed, inevitably grow into the purpose for which we were created: our own unique version of that oak tree." (xvi) 
    
- "No matter how 'enlightened' our ideas, none of us is immune to the social, political, and cultural indoctrinations of body shame. Without an intentional exploration of how (not if) we have adopted biased body-shame beliefs and a commitment to interrupting them as we continually seek to uncover them in ourselves, we will continue to obstruct the full manifestation of someone else's oak tree." (xvii) 
    
- "I have my own name for natural intelligence. I call it radical self-love, and this second edition is our opportunity to expand and unleash the full power of radical self-love as a tool for social change. In a time of unrest, uprisings, and a longing for what is possible beyond disconnection, radical self-love is a pathway toward personal and collective transformation... Evangelizing radical self-love as the transformative foundation of how we make peace with our bodies, make peace with the bodies of others, and ultimately change the world is my highest calling." (xvii) 
    

### Chapter 1 Making Self-Love Radical 

#### What Radical Self-Love Is and What It Ain't 

#### Why the Body? 

- "A radical self-love world is a world free from the systems of oppression that make it difficult and sometimes deadly to live in our bodies... A radical self-love world is a world that works for every body. Creating such a world is an inside-out job. How we value and honor our own bodies impacts how we value and honor the bodies of others... It is through our own transformed relationship with our bodies that we become champions for other bodies on our planet. As we awaken to our own indoctrinated body shame, we feel inspired to awaken others and to interrupt the systems that perpetuate body shame and oppression against all bodies... When we act from this truth on a global scale, using the lens of the body, we usher in the transformative opportunity of radical self-love, which is the opportunity for a more just, equitable, and compassionate world for us all." (5) 
    

#### Why Must It Be Radical? 

- "Using the term radical elevates the reality that our society requires a drastic political, economic, and social reformation in the ways in which we deal with bodies and body difference... Race, gender, and disability prejudice were written into the governing documents of the United States." (8) 
    
- "Radical self-love demands that we see ourselves and others in the fullness of our complexities and intersections and that we work to create space for those intersections. As has been true throughout history, changing the systemic and structural oppressions that regard us in perfunctory and myopic ways requires sweeping changes in our laws, policies, and social norms. Creating a world of justice for all bodies demands that we be radical and intersectional." (9)
