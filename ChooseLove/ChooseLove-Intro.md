## Introduction. With Love, From the End of the World
- "Sometimes it seems like the most painful cuts of all come from within my own community: Call-out culture. Lateral violence. Puritanical politics. Intimate partner abuse. Public shaming. We know so much about trauma but so little about how to heal it. What would 'community' know about saving us from the apocalypse." (9)
- "In 2016, I turned twenty-five years old and published my first novel... I became 'queer famous' that year... 
  
  My twenty-fifth year of life was also the year I experienced several devastating personal crises... social justice culture had not prepared me for the havoc that abuse, mental illness, and the immense pressure of living publicly as a tans woman of colour in the social media era could wreak upon my soul.
  
  Not only was I in pain, but my pain was publicly known, scrutinized, gossiped over. People, mostly queer and racialized people, whom I didn't know sent me emails and Facebook messages that were thousands of words long, asking for intimacy and attention and occasionally threatening me when I didn't acquiesce. Journalists asked me for interviews about my private life - my sex life, my family, my mental health; no topic seemed to be off limits. I was stalked, in real life and online. I became terrified and paranoid. I stopped trusting people and this thing we call 'community.' I stopped trusting myself.
  
  All around me, the people I loved were also in crisis - psychological, financial, medical, interpersonal. When you live in a community of queers, anarchists, and activists, crisis is the baseline and stability an outlier. Among trans women, a life expectancy of thirty-five is the norm.
  
  I lost my faith in community. I lost hope - in social justice, in revolution, in the world." (9-10)
  - "When we lose faith in the things that matter, it is easy to turn to **anger**. Anger helps us survive when survival seems impossible... Yet anger, and its siblings rage and vengeance, have also been poisonous influences in my communities..." (10)
  - "So in the midst of despair, I have come to believe that love - the feeling of love, the politics of love, the ethics and ideology and embodiment of love - is the only good option in this time of the apocalypse. What else do we have?
  
  I mean love that is kind but also honest. Love that is courageous and relentless and willing to break the rules and smash the system. Love that cares about people more than ideas, that prizes each and every one of us as essential and indispensable. I mean love that is compassionate and accountable. I mean love that confirms and reaffirms us as complex and fallible yet lovable anyways, love that affirms us as human." (10-11)
- "I want to live in love and believe in love. If I have to die, I want to die in love. This whole world might be coming to its end, or it might be in the midst of an enormous and terrifying change that leads to something better. Either way, I want to go through it in love with the people I love...
  
  So this is a book about love.  This is a book about revolutionary love. Love that might not save us at the end of the world but that might make it possible to live through. It may be hard to believe in. It will be harder to live. I hope we choose it anyway." (11)
