# Part 1: Let Us Live
## Chapter 1, Righteous Callings: Being Good, Leftist Orthodoxy, and the Social Justice Crisis of Faith
- "Deep down, I have always believed that I'm a bad person and that the world we live in is an awful place... Like most of my peers, all I wanted was to be good - or, in the fashionable parlance of various political movements in the past ten years, 'rad', 'down', or 'woke.' Like, my mentally ill transsexual ass was never gonna hack my parents' idea of goodness... but the *rad queer community* offered me a whole new set of norms for performance and lovability that, at least on the surface, gave value to the identity factors (transsexuality, effeminacy, mental illness, general bad attitude) that had caused me so much childhood shame."
