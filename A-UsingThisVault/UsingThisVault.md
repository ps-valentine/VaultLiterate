## Welcome!
This Vault is being setup for community use. While I don't yet have it available for this, look back to this page for more information in the future.

For all listings, I'm playing with a robust tagging system. For non-fiction books, I'm currently including large excerpts. For fiction books: character lists & plot summaries. Expect arc-level spoilers in summaries for comics. For scientific articles, there will be synposes or quoted abstracts, where succinct.

## Documentation Standards
### Plot Summaries
I'll try to keep plot summaries of fiction books folded, using the syntax \"> [!hint]- Plot Summary..." or \">[!hint]- ¡SPOILERS!: Plot Summary...". I'll keep them as concise as I can, while giving enough information to use this list to identify recommendations. Avoid reviewing the tags if you want to entirely avoid spoilers, though I try not to go into excessive detail.
### Titling
#### Comics
For comic titling (under Files), the title will be "(Year of Series Start)-Title" or "(Year of Series Start)-AbbreviatedTitle" where necessary.
