## Welcome!
This Vault is being setup for community use. While I don't yet have it available for this, look back to this page for more information in the future.

For all listings, I'm playing with a robust tagging system. For non-fiction books, I'm currently including large excerpts. For fiction books: character lists & plot summaries. For scientific articles, synposes.

## Documentation Standards
### Plot Summaries
I'll try to keep plot summaries of fiction books folded, using the syntax \"> [!info]-  Plot Summary". I'll also keep them as concise as I can, while giving enough information to use this list to determine what you might like to read. Avoid reviewing the tags if you want to entirely avoid spoilers, though I try not to go into excessive detail.
