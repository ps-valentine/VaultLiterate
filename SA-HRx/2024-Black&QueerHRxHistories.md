Johnson, Sterline and Kimberley L. Sue. “Drawing on Black and Queer Communities’ Harm Reduction Histories to Improve Overdose Prevention Strategies and Policies.” *AMA Journal of Ethics* 26, no. 7 (2024): e580-586, https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/drawing-black-and-queer-communities-harm-reduction-histories-improve-overdose-prevention-strategies/2024-07
- **Abstract**: "Harm reduction emerged as a set of strategies developed by and for people who use opioids and other substances and strive to do so in ways that are as safe as possible. This article reviews histories of Black and queer community-based harm reduction practices and suggests how these histories can inform harm reduction policy and guide development and implementation of anti-overdose interventions."
- "**Harm reduction**... is also a philosophy and practice born of people's lived experience of structural violence arising from the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the late 1980s."
- "**Harm reduction** must be seen as an evolving and emergent set of strategies that can be utilized and adapted by people who use drugs or engage in sex work; to prevent harms associated with these practices, public health officers and medical professionals must work in tandem with local communities to implement harm reduction interventions and promote harm reduction policies."
- "...more than 110,000 overdose deaths in the... 12-month period ending August 2023 - largely due to the rise of illicitly manufactured fentanyl in the unregulated drug supply."
### **Pioneers in Harm Reduction**
- "In the United States, this multiracial movement was led by Black, Latinx, Muslim, and queer communities that started HIV/AIDS groups for structurally vulnerable people at risk for HIV and harms of substance use."
- "Imani Woods, Dan Bigg, John Paul Hammond, Keith Cylar, Charles King, Kiyoshi Kuromiya, Michael Hinson, Dr Rashidah Abdul-Khabeer, Waheedah Shabazz-El, Jose Demarco, Paul Yabor, Charlene Arcila, Jaci Adams, John Bell, and Tyrone Smith are an incomplete list of minoritized harm reduction pioneers in the United States."
- "**Dr Abdul-Khabheer**, for example, is a Black registered nurse who founded a group called Bebashi (Blacks Educating Blacks About Sexual Health Issues) in 1985 and played an essential role in the Philadelphia HIV prevention scene for Black women."
- "**Jose de Marco**, a Black and Puerto Rican queer man, was foundational to the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power Philadelphia, which was organized by the queer community and protested for decades for access to HIV medications and harm reduction efforts across the country."
- "**Imani Woods**... writes about how she converted from being a staunch opponent of harm reduction—even calling harm reduction a genocidal operation—to grasping the power of providing practical tools to ensure health and protect the Black community against the harms of HIV and substance use. Her transformation occurred in 1989, when she witnessed a man displaying sterile syringes on a table out in the open and how individuals came up to him and exchanged their used syringes and took educational materials.
- "Harm reduction was also a global movement... The earliest harm reduction efforts originated in the Netherlands in the 1980s, when the Junky Union distributed sterile syringes in solidarity with community health care workers to prevent HIV and hepatitis B transmission."
- "In the United States, early needle exchanges emerged in Tacoma, Washington, and in New Haven, Connecticut."
- "\[I]n 2002, nurses at the Dr Peter Centre in Vancouver started supervising injections with the support of the Registered Nursing Association of British Columbia, which stated that it was part of their ethical obligations and duties as nurses to supervise drug consumption and ensure the safety of patients under their care."
- "In an act of civil disobedience, a nurse was arrested as one of the so-called “Needle Eight” who was tried in New York City in 1991 for handing out clean needles to protest the illegality of syringe service provision under Mayor Dinkins."
- "Doctors like Sarz Maxwell and Shawn DeLater participated in harm reduction services that distributed naloxone in Chicago in the late 1990s before the establishment of legal frameworks."
### **Formal Harm Reduction Frameworks**
- The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) convened in 2023 "to draft a harm reduction framework. The framework builds on the expansion of syringe access programs, naloxone access legislation, and harm reduction technical assistance, as well as decades of advocacy by communities and advocates doing this work. The framework outlines several core values, such as respecting autonomy and practicing acceptance of people who use drugs."
- "\[H]arm reduction organizations that specialize in prioritizing assistance to people experiencing homelessness (eg, VOCAL-NY’s homeless union), street-based sex workers (eg, Project SAFE), women and non-binary people (eg, Metzineres), Black or other racialized peoples (eg, HIPS), or trans people (eg, Ark of Safety)" are all organizations providing harm reduction services to minoritized individuals.
- "The harm reduction principles adopted by the SAMHSA framework have not arisen in an ahistorical vacuum, and they risk losing their original radical meaning and nature upon becoming mainstream and being adopted by public health more broadly. If interpreted within a narrow clinical scope, these principles can lose their community-oriented origins and focus myopically on individual behavioral interventions without recognizing political and economic structures of violence and harm. Thus, funding for minoritized groups and their community development and resilience must be specifically earmarked in harm reduction proposals."
### **Contested Histories**
- "As historian David Musto has argued, US drug policy swings between periods of relative liberalization and relative conservatism, as well as between a medical or public health approach and criminalization."
- "Imani Woods’ legacy of community building among minoritized groups by funding and empowering them provides some steps forward. Woods focused primarily on the Black community, analyzing the struggle for harm reduction in the context of Black employment, health, and general opportunities. Woods understood that harm reduction and public health programs led by White people would be viewed with suspicion by the Black community due to its members’ history of slavery and experience of violence. Faced with increased overdose rates among minoritized populations, clinicians and communities alike must take these histories into account for interventions to be relevant or effective. Woods framed the overdose crisis as requiring an understanding of self-determination of individuals and their communities. She argued for the need to reckon with racialized drug policy harms and leverage the resilience of Black people."
### **Looking Back to Envision Forward**
- "Harm reduction must be accompanied by decriminalization efforts, such as Oregon’s (partially reversed in 2024)."
- "There are clear policy goals to advance harm reduction in communities facing racialized disparities in overdose deaths. Clinicians must work with local harm reduction groups at the clinic and statehouse level to provide them with expansive support, including in states like Texas. Clinicians must not be gatekeepers or moralizers but rather must partner with communities to create accessible, affordable, and low-barrier access to all services people need to obtain health and well-being... Involving people with trusted histories in their communities, such as Imani Woods, to participate in all levels of decision-making and fairly compensating them is vital. Funding must be specifically allocated to community groups led by people of color, as well as to organizational development and fostering of young leaders. Finally, policy and research efforts should be intersectional by design and co-created by people with lived and living experience of substance use."
