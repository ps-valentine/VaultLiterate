## Abstract
### **Abstract, Background and Objectives**
"Methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) is a major public health problem, but there are no evidence-based, best-practice, pharmacologic, or behavioral treatments for it. Narcotics Anonymous (NA) may provide an option for referral for such patients."
### **Abstract, Discussion and Conclusions**
"NA served as a resource for supporting abstinence for some members with MUD. They scored social resources of NA support higher than both spiritual and outside institutional ones."

This study was produced based on surveys distributed to members by Narcotics Anonymous World Service in partnership with the researchers. These surveys were optional, anonymized & un-incentivized; they were distributed in March 2020 and June 2021, during the COVID pandemic.
## Introduction
- "Neurotoxic effects of methamphetamine occur from repeated use, resulting in neurocognitive defects, and persisting even after a period of abstinence."
- "In 2012, federal legislation was passed to limit over-the-counter sales of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine because of their use in synthesizing methamphetamine in local US laboratories. Subsequent illicit importation of the drug from Mexico, however, has made large quantities available. Consequently, subsequent increased availability of higher purity methamphetamine has made medical consequences more prominent; use of the drug has increased considerably in the United States in recent years."
- Per the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), "among adults reporting methamphetamine use in 2018, 27.3% reported using it on more than 200 days, and 22.3% had injected it."
- "Data from poison control centers show admission to healthcare facilities rose from 30.2% in 2000 to 47.8% in 2019."
- "Methamphetamine-related hospital admissions as a portion of all drug-related admissions increased from 15.1% in 2008 to 23.6% in 2017. Increased attention to opioids in recent years, such as heroin and fentanyl, has predominated regarding the problem of drug overdoses, but by 2018, methamphetamine accounted for 11% of all reported overdose deaths."
- "Numerous pharmacologic agents have been applied to address MUD in clinical trials in an attempt to reduce this drug's misuse, such as modafinil, topiramate, sertraline, and naltrexone. A reduction in craving has not been reported in a comprehensive literature review on clinical pharmacologic trials."
- "With regard to psychosocial treatment, two uncontrolled studies have shown positive results, one on contingency management and another employing the Matrix model, a multimodal, manualized approach. NIDA points out that the 'most effective' treatments for MUD are behavioral, such as cognitive behavioral and contingency management interventions."
## Methods
Data collection included information related to: in-person versus online attendance, duration of abstinence, relative cravings, NA-related sources of support in recovery, professional therapy, medications for psychological distress, and attendance at a house of worship, among other metrics.
## Results
- "There were 347 respondents in the first wave survey who listed methamphetamine as their principal drug of abuse," with the ethnic breakdown of respondents being approximately 85% white, 5% Black, 5% Hispanic/Latino and 8% other. On average, respondents were around 50 years old and had last used substances 13 years ago. 47% had a history of intravenous (IV) drug use, 27% had been referred to NA by a healthcare professional and about 50% had received psychological treatment besides medication.
- "Participants reported higher drug craving during the pandemic than before", with "greater involvement in providing assistance to other members" (as a sponsor or by contributing to the NA service) correlating with lower craving.
- "Almost half of the respondents (47.4%) reported having experienced a relapse since joining NA..."
- "\[R]espondents who indicated that _other members_ were not important to their recovery were no less likely to rate _God_ and _spiritual awakening_ as resources important to their recovery. Respondents who indicated that _God_ was not important to their recovery were more likely to rate social items as important to their recovery; and were least likely to rate _NA prayer_ or _house of worship_ as important. Respondents who indicated that a _therapist_ was not important to their recovery were more likely to rate all other NA-based items as more important to their recovery, but not medications... Differences between genders also indicated a different pattern of reliance. Among male respondents, only 35.9% indicated that professional help (including both therapist and/or medications for psychological problems) was a resource for recovery support whereas 63.2% of females found professional help to be a resource."

## Discussion
- "**Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)**, a behaviorally oriented approach to alcohol use disorder (AUD), originated in 1935, and a definitive review of literature on AA facilitation showed it more effective than other established treatments, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, for encouraging abstinence. In relation to nonalcohol use disorders, NA was initially developed by opioid-dependent persons employing AA's Twelve Step model."
- "In a recent study by NA's World Service Center of 8239 members, 49% listed stimulants as their “main drugs used,” more commonly than opioids"
## Limitations
Discussion of their study population being "limited to the small number of persons accessed from the larger NA membership... Respondents were fully committed members, having many years since their first encounter with NA, had experienced a spiritual awakening, and had involvement with sponsorship. None of the data we accessed came from NA members who had recently joined or had left the fellowship because of relapse."
## Conclusion
"\[F]or some persons with this disorder, the \[Narcotics Anonymous] fellowship can offer a non-pharmacologic approach to achieving recovery. The findings are also useful in gaining an understanding of how members themselves with MUD see their recovery as stabilized in the fellowship. Such findings can be helpful for investigating mechanisms of action for this peer-based program, and as a resource for clinicians to consider for their patients with MUD."
