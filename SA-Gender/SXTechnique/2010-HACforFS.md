Lee, Dong Won, Ji Ye Kim, and Dae Hyun Lew. “Use of Rapidly Hardening Hydroxyapatite Cement for Facial Contouring Surgery.” Journal of Craniofacial Surgery 21, no. 4 (2010): 1084-1088, [https://journals.lww.com/jcraniofacialsurgery/fulltext/2010/07000/use_of_rapidly_hardening_hydroxyapatite_cement_for.32.aspx](https://journals.lww.com/jcraniofacialsurgery/fulltext/2010/07000/use_of_rapidly_hardening_hydroxyapatite_cement_for.32.aspx) 

Exactly what it sounds like! **Rapidly-hardening hydroxyapatite cement (HAC)** is currently the top-of-the-line biocompatible bone cement and this article investigates its usage in some detail. It allows for ossification (natural bone will replace some of the HAC over time), molds easily, and doesn’t generate heat as it hardens – which can cause damage to surrounding tissues if proper precautions are not taken – as do some other bone cements.
