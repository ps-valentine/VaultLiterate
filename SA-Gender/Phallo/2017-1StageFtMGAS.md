## Abstract
### Background
"Female-to-male gender-confirmation surgery (GCS) includes removal of breasts and female genitalia and complete genital and urethral reconstruction. With a multidisciplinary approach, these procedures can be performed in one stage, avoiding multistage operations."
### Aim
### Methods
"During a period of 9 years (2007e2016), 473 patients (mean age ¼ 31.5 years) underwent
metoidioplasty. Of these, 137 (29%) underwent simultaneous hysterectomy, and 79 (16.7%) underwent one-stage GCS consisting of chest masculinization, total transvaginal hysterectomy with bilateral adnexectomy, vaginectomy, metoidioplasty, urethral lengthening, scrotoplasty, and implantation of bilateral testicular prostheses. All surgeries were performed simultaneously by teams of experienced gynecologic and gender surgeons."
### Outcomes
"Primary outcome measurements were surgical time, length of hospital stay, and complication and reoperation rates compared with other published data and in relation to the number of stages needed to complete GCS."
### Results
Mean follow-up was 44 months (range = 10-92). Mean surgery time was 270 minutes (range = 215-325). Postoperative hospital stay was 3 to 6 days (mean = 4). Complications occurred in 20 patients (25.3%). Six patients (7.6%) had complications related to mastectomy, and one patient underwent revision surgery because of a breast hematoma. Two patients underwent conversion of transvaginal hysterectomy to an abdominal approach, and subcutaneous perineal cyst, as a consequence of colpocleisis, occurred in nine patients. There were eight complications (10%) from urethroplasty, including four fistulas, three strictures, and one diverticulum. Testicular implant rejection occurred in two patients and testicular implant displacement occurred in one patient."
### Clinical Implications
### Strengths and Limitations
"To our knowledge, this is the largest cohort on this topic so far, with good surgical
outcomes. Limitations include lack of selection or exclusion criteria and lack of other studies with a simple approach. For this reason, the technique should be studied further and compared with other techniques for female-to-male surgery before it can be recommended as an alternative procedure."
### Conclusions
"Through a multidisciplinary approach of experienced teams, one-stage GCS presents a safe, viable, and time- and cost-saving procedure. **Complication rates do not differ from reported rates in multistage surgeries.**"
## Introduction
## Aims
## Methods
"From January 2007 through March 2016, 473 female transsexuals 18 to 56 years old (mean age ¼ 31.5) underwent metoidioplasty. Of these, 79 patients (16.7%) with a mean age of 25.5 years (range = 18-43) underwent bilateral mastectomy, vaginectomy, hysterectomy, and oophorectomy performed at the same
stage with metoidioplasty. The single-stage procedure was based on the simultaneous work of a team of experienced gynecologists and a team of gender surgeons... Patients had been receiving hormonal treatment for a mean period of 3 years (range = 18 months to 23 years). The clitoris had been additionally enlarged using dihydrotestosterone as a topical gel and a vacuum device during the 6-month period leading up to surgery (Figure 1A)."
### Operative Technique
- "The one-stage surgery includes bilateral mastectomy, transvaginal hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy, vaginectomy and metoidioplasty with urethral lengthening, and testicular prosthesis implantation. The approach begins with mastectomy and hysterectomy simultaneously and is followed by metoidioplasty."
- "The appropriate mastectomy technique is preoperatively planned for each patient. The main criteria for technique selection are breast size, degree of excessive skin, quality of the skin, and the position of the areola. The transareolar approach is preferred, including reduction of the nipple-areola complex. However, for large breasts and poor skin elasticity, radical mastectomy is performed, with free grafting of the nipple-areola complex. A circumferential elastic bandage is placed around the chest wall postoperatively for 8 to 10 weeks."
- "The uterus and ovaries are removed using a minimally invasive transvaginal approach, leaving the abdominal wall scar free to avoid compromising possible abdominal phalloplasty in the future. Vaginectomy is performed by total removal of the vaginal mucosa (colpocleisis), with preservation of the part of anterior vaginal wall near the urethra, which will be used for urethral lengthening."
- "Reconstruction of the genitalia (metoidioplasty) includes complete straightening and lengthening of the clitoris by division of both clitoral ligaments and the short urethral plate, urethroplasty by combining the buccal mucosa graft and genital flaps, and scrotoplasty with insertion of testicular implants. Reconstruction of the neophallus starts with the incision beneath the glans, at the border between the inner and outer layers of the clitoral prepuce, and continues around the urethral plate and native urethral orifice. After complete degloving, all clitoral ligaments are divided to advance the clitoris. Ventrally, the short urethral plate is dissected from the clitoral bodies without injury to the spongiosa tissue around the urethral plate to prevent extreme bleeding. Dissection includes the bulbar part of the plate around the native orifice to enable good mobility for urethral lengthening. Because the urethral plate is always short, causing the ventral clitoral curvature, it is divided at the level of the glanular corona. In this way, complete straightening and lengthening of the clitoris are achieved. The bulbar part of the neourethra is created by joining the flap harvested from anterior vaginal wall and the proximal part of divided urethral plate. Additional urethral lengthening is achieved by combining a buccal mucosa graft harvested from the inner cheek and vascularized genital skin flaps. The length of the graft depends on the distance from the tip of the glans to the native urethral orifice and in our cases ranged from 4.5 to 7 cm. The graft is fixed and quilted to the corporeal bodies starting from the advanced urethral meatus to the tip of the glans. Further urethral reconstruction is achieved using a labia minora flap or a dorsal clitoral skin flap. The inner part of the labia minora is dissected without detachment from the outer labial surface to create a well-vascularized flap that is joined with the buccal mucosa graft over a 12- to 14-Fr stent to create a neourethra without tension (Figure 1B, C). In this way, the outer surface of the labia minora covers all suture lines forming the ventral penile skin. The glans is opened by two parallel incisions and the two glans wings are dissected extensively to enable glans closure without tension. The penile shaft is created using all available and vascularized clitoral and labia minora skin (Figure 1D). The labia majora are joined at the midline to create the scrotum and penoscrotal angle. Silicone testicular implants are inserted through two incisions placed at the top of the scrotum (Figure 1E). Suprapubic urine drainage is placed in all cases for 3 weeks. The urethral stent is removed after 10 days. Postoperative use of a vacuum pump is necessary to prevent retraction of the neophallus, starting 3 weeks after surgery."

## Main Outcome Measures
"Primary outcome measurements were surgical time, length of hospital stay, and complication and reoperation rates compared with other published data and in relation to the number of stages needed to complete reassignment surgery. **Patients’ self-reported psychosexual outcomes and esthetic and functional outcomes also were evaluated.**"
## Results
- "Follow-up ranged from 10 to 92 months (mean = 44). Surgery time ranged from 215 to 325 minutes (mean = 270). Postoperative hospital stay was 3 to 6 days (mean = 4)."
- "The mean length of the neophallus was 6.8 cm (range = 5-9.8). The intraoperatively measured length of the neourethra was 8.5 to 14 cm (mean = 10.6). Complications occurred in 20 of 79 patients (25.3%)."
	![[2017-1Stage-Tab1.png]]
- "Transareolar and radical mastectomy with free nipple graft was performed in 18 and 61 cases, respectively. Complications occurred only in the group with the free nipple graft technique. One patient received blood transfusion because of excessive bleeding caused by previously undiagnosed von Willebrand disease. In two patients, transvaginal hysterectomy was converted to the abdominal approach to obtain bleeding control; in nine patients, postoperative subcutaneous perineal cyst occurred as a consequence of colpocleisis."
- "Revision surgery was performed in nine patients (11.3%) 6 to 12 months after primary surgery. One patient underwent revision after mastectomy because of breast hematoma. In the patients who developed complications related to urethral reconstruction (10.1%), minor surgery was performed to repair urethral fistula in two cases, stricture in one case, and diverticulum in one case. Testicular implant rejection and dislocation also required revision surgery in three patients. In all nine cases, removal of the perineal cyst and perineoplasty were performed simultaneously (Table 1)."
- "Most patients (96.2%) were satisfied with the new appearance of their genitalia and breasts (Figure 2). There were no complications related to sexual function. Good quality of erection, sexual arousal, and completely preserved erogenous sensation were reported by all patients. Voiding while standing was ultimately achieved in all cases (Figure 3, Table 2). In 10 patients (12.7%) who also required neophallus-plasty, a microvascular latissimus dorsi muscle flap transfer was performed."
## Discussion
- "In FtM transsexuals, gender-confirmation surgery means a multistage procedure that ultimately leads to the desired result. It usually starts with hysterectomy and bilateral mastectomy performed simultaneously or in two stages. In many countries, hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy are a postulate for legal recognition of the desired male sex, and for this reason many transgender men decide to start with this procedure. Mastectomy is very important for these persons, because breasts are an obvious female attribute, and it can be combined with hysterectomy, as previously reported. Reconstruction of the genitalia, as the most complex and challenging procedure, also usually requires at least two stages."
- " The main advantages of this \[combined] approach are minimal blood loss, acceptable length of surgery, fast recovery, low complication rate, and no special difference compared with each of these procedures performed separately in a multistage manner. All complications occurred in 20 patients, although only 9 (11.3%) underwent minor revisions. In addition, patients have an important benefit in avoiding multiple operations under general anesthesia (ie, saving time and decreasing costs) without increased surgery risks and complication rates."
- "In our series, the overall rate of mastectomy-specific complications was 7.6% and related only to the free nipple graft technique, including one case of breast hematoma that required revision surgery (1.2%). These data are comparable to the data of different studies reporting chest masculinization in transsexual patients. Breast hematoma has been reported as the most frequent complication after mastectomy in FtM transgender patients, with rates up to 12.5%.4 Acute reoperation rates of 4% and 5% were reported in the largest series that included bilateral mastectomy in 92 and 202 FtM patients, respectively."
	![[2017-1Stage-Tab2.png]]
- "We prefer the transvaginal approach for hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy. It has been determined as the optimal route of hysterectomy for benign indications in women and for FtM transsexuals. Compared with the abdominal laparoscopy-assisted and robot-assisted approach, vaginal hysterectomy is associated with a shorter operative time, a lower infection rate, and lower cost. For FtM gender-reassignment surgery, the additional advantage of the transvaginal approach is the absence of scars and avoiding injuries of the rectus muscle, which is an important precondition for later phalloplasty."
- "Kaiser et al,16 in one of the largest studies on vaginal hysterectomy in FtM transsexuals, reported only 5.4% of complications in 103 cases, with mean duration of surgery of 52 minutes. In 2 of our 79 patients (2.5%), it was necessary to convert the initial vaginal to abdominal hysterectomy because of excessive bleeding and hematoma formation. There were no other complications. These results are consistent with current studies dealing with hysterectomy in transsexuals and non-transsexual patients surgically treated for benign illnesses of the uterus. All our patients underwent colpocleisis, as a preferred method of colpectomy, because it is a safe, short, and bloodless procedure. However, a postoperative perineal cyst as a vaginal mucosa remnant occurred in nine patients (11.3%), requiring minor revision."
## Conclusions
"Based on our results, we consider our procedure of hysterectomy, bilateral mastectomy, and metoidioplasty with urethral lengthening as single-stage surgery to be feasible, safe, and efficient for FtM transsexuals. It should be presented as a viable option of gender-confirmation surgery for these patients, but without defined selection criteria. The key for a successful outcome is the simultaneous multidisciplinary work of experienced and skilled teams."
