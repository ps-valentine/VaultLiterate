# Genital Hypoplasia before Gender-Affirming Vaginoplasty: Does the Robotic Peritoneal Flap Method Create Equivalent Vaginal Canal Outcomes?
## Abstract
### Background
"Insufficient genital tissue has been reported as a barrier to achieving depth in gender-affirming vaginoplasty. The authors sought to characterize vaginal depth and revision outcomes in patients with genital hypoplasia undergoing robotic peritoneal flap vaginoplasty."
### Methods
"Retrospective case-control analysis of patients undergoing robotic peritoneal vaginoplasty between September of 2017 and August of 2020 was used. All 43 patients identified as having genital hypoplasia (genital length <7 cm) were included with 49 random controls from the remaining patients with greater than 7 cm genital length... Outcomes measured included vaginal size reported at last visit and undergoing revision surgery for depth or for vulvar appearance."
### Results
"Patients were well matched other than median body mass index at the time of surgery, which was greater in the hypoplasia cohort by 3.6 kg/m2 (P < 0.0001). Patients had a median of 1-year of follow-up, with a minimum follow-up of 90 days. No significant differences in outcomes were observed, with a median vaginal depth of 14.5 cm... and a median width of dilator used of 3.8 cm... No depth revisions were observed, and an 11% (n = 10) rate of external revision occurred."
### Conclusions
## Introduction
- "Meta-analysis of the literature reports vaginal depths of 9.4 cm for penile inversion vaginoplasty and 15.3 cm for bowel pedicle vaginoplasty, and a 90% visual appearance satisfaction rate overall."
- "Short genital length can be an indication for sigmoid colon vaginoplasty or additional full-thickness skin graft of abdominal or scrotal skin, as there is insufficient genital skin to line the vaginal canal using penile-inversion techniques. Each has drawbacks, including risks related to bowel anastomosis, and visible scarring if extragenital skin graft is used. Depending on the technique used, penoscrotal hypoplasia can also affect reconstruction of vulvar subunits. Additional barriers to vaginal canal depth and width include narrow pelvic dimensions, preoperative pelvic floor dysfunction, and difficulty in dissecting the vaginal space. After surgery, pelvic floor dysfunction can prevent the regular dilation needed to maintain vaginal depth and width. Currently, tissue use in gender-affirming vaginoplasty is variable, with penile, scrotal, and urethral epithelium used in differing locations, including the vulva, introitus, and vaginal canal."
- "Our surgical center has reported the largest case series of primary penile inversion robotic peritoneal flap vaginoplasty. Our technique involves dissection of the vaginal canal by means of the rectovesical pouch, and creation of a vaginal lining that combines penile skin, scrotal skin, and peritoneal flaps in patients undergoing primary vaginoplasty. There is a potential for increased depth in all patients, as unlike the penile inversion method, the rectovesical pouch of the peritoneal cavity is incorporated in the canal."
## Patients and Methods
- "A total of 199 consecutive patients undergoing robotic peritoneal vaginoplasty in the senior author’s (R.B.L.) practice from September of 2017 to August of 2020 were reviewed, with in-person and video postoperative visits captured through February of 2021."
- "We have previously described our technique for robotic assisted vaginal canal dissection and peritoneal flap creation using the da Vinci SP robotic platform (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA) and our method of vulvar creation with scrotal tissue not harvested for use in the vaginal canal... A combination of penile skin, scrotal skin, and peritoneal flaps is used for vaginal canal creation, demonstrated in Figure 1. The peritoneal flaps are relatively consistent in size, measuring approximately 10 × 10 cm, and are connected to the scrotal skin graft, usually 4 cm long and 12 cm in circumference (4 cm long fitted around a 3.8-cm diameter dilator). The scrotal skin graft is occasionally not used if the penile skin flap length is sufficient to reach peritoneal flaps. Our approach to vulvar anatomy creation uses scrotal skin to create the labia majora, penile skin to create the labia minora, and preputial or distal shaft skin to create the clitoral hood."

- "Patients for whom stretched genital shaft length was measured at the time of consultation \[n = 188 (94.5%)] were evaluated to determine the lowest quartile for presurgical genital length... The lowest quartile’s resulting measurement was less than 7 cm.
  
  All patients whose measurement was less than 7 cm were included in the genital hypoplasia cohort (n = 43). Forty-three hypoplasia patients were compared with 49 randomly selected controls from the remaining patients with greater than 7-cm genital length... The only differences in cohorts were expected findings related to differing genital length, including lower measured body mass index (BMI) and fewer uses of scrotal skin graft in the vaginal canal in control patients."
