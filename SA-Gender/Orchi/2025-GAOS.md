## Abstract
### Background
"Gender-affirming orchiectomy is well described; however, a subset of patients may also seek scrotectomy to alleviate dysphoria related to the scrotum. Techniques and outcomes of gender-affirming orchiectomy and scrotectomy (GAOS) have not been described to date."
### Methods
"We retrospectively reviewed all patients who had undergone GAOS from 2021 to 2024 at our institution. The World Professional Association for Transgender Health criteria for surgical treatment were met preoperatively, and patients understood vaginoplasty was not recommended post-scrotectomy. Two approaches were offered: excision of a majority of scrotal tissue and primary closure of the perineal wound, or excision of all rugated skin with mons and groin (Y-flap) advancement. Patient-reported outcomes questionnaires from the PROMIS® Sexual Function and Satisfaction Measures, version 2.0, along with questions specific to post-scrotectomy anatomy, were sent postoperatively."
### Results
"Eight patients, median age 31 years, underwent GAOS with a preoperative hormone duration of 26.5 months. All patients reported dysphoria related to the scrotum and testes, and wished to preserve the phallus. Five elected for primary closure, three for Y-flap perineoplasty. At median 97-day follow-up, all reported satisfaction and dysphoria relief. One patient with Y-flap experienced wound dehiscence requiring operative revision. Four reported sexual activity with the ability to achieve erection and orgasm."
### Conclusions
## Background
- \[There has been] "substantial growth in the frequency of GAS procedures, with research revealing an almost threefold increase in the total number of surgeries performed between 2016 and 2020. "
- "While orchiectomy is well-described, techniques and outcomes for gender-affirming orchiectomy and scrotectomy (GAOS) have to date not been discussed in the literature. Here, we present our initial experience with GAOS, as a viable option for AMAB patients who experience dysphoria related to the scrotum and testes, but do not desire a vaginoplasty and/or who wish to retain the phallus."
## Methods
### Indications for procedure
- "In addition, patients seeking GAOS specifically may also describe dysphoria owing to the presence of the scrotum itself, rugated skin, or midline raphe. While phenotypic sex presents on a spectrum determined by genetic and hormonal, the rugation of scrotal skin is a direct result of testosterone exposure in utero and thus is a primary sex characteristic."
- "Patients are counseled on the permanency of GAOS, and that vulvar or vaginal construction following this would be significantly more challenging owing to limited availability of tissue."
