## Abstract
### Background
"...\[T]ranswomen who undergo cross-sex hormone treatments experience increased health-related risks (e.g., increased rates of cardiovascular disease and premature death). Yet, the exact mechanism by which altering biochemistry leads to metabolic impairment remains unclear. While much attention has been paid to cross-sex hormone therapy, **little is known about the metabolic risk associated with orchiectomy.**"
### Methods
Study sample included "12 transwomen: 4 who had undergone bi-lateral orchiectomy and 8 who had not. Both groups were using cross-sex hormones."
### Results
"The major novel findings were: (1) **orchiectomy and cross-sex hormone therapy is associated with less hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance**; (2) **orchiectomy may be metabolically protective**, and (3) **circulating concentrations of sex hormones may be a major determinant of metabolic health in transwomen.**"
### Conclusions
"To our knowledge, this is the first study to suggest an independent and protective role of orchiectomy on the metabolic health of transwomen."
## Introduction
- "The United States has an estimated 8–16 million people (0.2–0.5% of the population) whose gender identity does not match their biological gender at birth."
- "... little is known about relationships between hormonal and surgical therapy and cardiometabolic health. There are some observations suggesting that cross-sex hormone administration may be associated with the metabolic syndrome among transwomen; however, the mechanistic underpinnings for these observations remain unclear and the role of orchiectomy unexplored. **We hypothesized that cross-sex hormone therapy without orchiectomy would be associated with an adverse cardiometabolic status.**"
## Methods
Study participants were taking estradiol, with spironolactone if they had not yet undergone orchiectomy. "Exclusion criteria included the following: individuals with type 2 diabetes, age <18 years, body mass index (BMI) >44 kg/m2, contraindications to magnetic resonance imaging, and use of medications known to alter hepatic triglyceride content."
### Anthropometric measurements and OGTT
### Adiposity
### H MRS of hepatic triglyceride content
"Fasting glucose and insulin levels were used for homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, and the composite insulin sensitivity index was estimated from the glucose and insulin concentrations during the OGTT."
### Biochemical analysis
#### Baseline and OGTT
#### Sex hormones
#### Statistical analysis
