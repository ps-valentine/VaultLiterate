## Abstract
### Background
"...\[T]ranswomen who undergo cross-sex hormone treatments experience increased health-related risks (e.g., increased rates of cardiovascular disease and premature death). Yet, the exact mechanism by which altering biochemistry leads to metabolic impairment remains unclear. While much attention has been paid to cross-sex hormone therapy, **little is known about the metabolic risk associated with orchiectomy.**"
### Methods
Study sample included "12 transwomen: 4 who had undergone bi-lateral orchiectomy and 8 who had not. Both groups were using cross-sex hormones."
### Results
"The major novel findings were: (1) **orchiectomy and cross-sex hormone therapy is associated with less hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance**; (2) **orchiectomy may be metabolically protective**, and (3) **circulating concentrations of sex hormones may be a major determinant of metabolic health in transwomen.**"
### Conclusions
"To our knowledge, this is the first study to suggest an independent and protective role of orchiectomy on the metabolic health of transwomen."
## Introduction
- "The United States has an estimated 8–16 million people (0.2–0.5% of the population) whose gender identity does not match their biological gender at birth."
- "... little is known about relationships between hormonal and surgical therapy and cardiometabolic health. There are some observations suggesting that cross-sex hormone administration may be associated with the metabolic syndrome among transwomen; however, the mechanistic underpinnings for these observations remain unclear and the role of orchiectomy unexplored. **We hypothesized that cross-sex hormone therapy without orchiectomy would be associated with an adverse cardiometabolic status.**"
## Methods
Study participants were taking estradiol, with spironolactone if they had not yet undergone orchiectomy. "Exclusion criteria included the following: individuals with type 2 diabetes, age <18 years, body mass index (BMI) >44 kg/m2, contraindications to magnetic resonance imaging, and use of medications known to alter hepatic triglyceride content."
### Anthropometric measurements and OGTT
### Adiposity
### H MRS of hepatic triglyceride content
### Biochemical analysis
#### Baseline and OGTT
"Fasting glucose and insulin levels were used for homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, and the composite insulin sensitivity index was estimated from the glucose and insulin concentrations during the OGTT."
#### Sex hormones
#### Statistical analysis
"Secondary analysis revealed within group differences in circulating sex hormones, further dividing the subjects into three groups: (1) testes−, (2) testes+ with “low” testosterone concentrations, and (3) testes+ with “high” testosterone concentrations."
## Results
![[2016-Orchi-Table1.png]]
- "Testes+ transwomen tended to have an overall heightened insulin response to the glucose challenge ([Fig. 1B](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5685281/#f1)), when compared to testes− transwomen. Despite similar plasma glucose levels during the OGTT... the AUC for insulin was more than twofold higher in testes+ transwomen compared to testes− transwomen... and plasma insulin was significantly elevated in the testes+ transwomen compared to testes− transwomen... In line with this insulin resistance, plasma adiponectin was also nearly twofold lower in testes+ transwomen versus testes− transwomen..."
- "Consistently, those individuals with the greatest levels of hepatic triglyceride also were the most insulin resistant..."
- "As expected, serum sex-hormone levels differed between testes+ and testes− transwomen. Testes+ transwomen had higher levels of testosterone, free testosterone and bioavailable testosterone (free testosterone plus albumin-bound testosterone), and lower levels of sex hormone-binding globulin, compared to testes− transwomen ([[2016-Orchi-Table1.png|Table 1]]). In addition, estradiol was lower in the testes+ transwomen compared to testes− transwomen ([[2016-Orchi-Table1.png|Table 1]]). The groups did not differ in cortisol, DHEAS, androstenedione, or estrone levels ([[2016-Orchi-Table1.png|Table 1]])."
- "In addition, we found significant within-group differences, independent of hormonal therapy. In particular, four of the eight testes+ transwomen had significantly higher levels of testosterone when compared to the remaining testes+ or testes− transwomen ([Fig. 2A–C](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5685281/#f2), High T group). Moreover, the four transwomen with the highest testosterone levels (High T group) also had the lowest levels of estradiol ([Fig. 2B](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5685281/#f2)) and SHBG..."
- "Importantly, **transwomen with the highest levels of testosterone also tended to have the highest hepatic steatosis** ([Fig. 3A](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5685281/#f3)) **and insulin resistance** ([Fig. 3B](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5685281/#f3)). One participant (open circle, [Fig. 3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5685281/#f3)) with the highest hepatic steatosis in the “Testes+, Low T” group also had the greatest insulin resistance within that group, further strengthening the potential mechanistic relationship between these two outcomes in this cohort."
## Discussion
- "To our knowledge, this is the first study to specifically compare transwomen with and without orchiectomy related to cardiometabolic measures, including hepatic steatosis, insulin sensitivity, and serum hormonal levels."
- "We report three major new findings: (1) **orchiectomy and cross-sex therapy is associated with less hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance** when compared to cross-sex hormone therapy alone, (2) **insulin resistance is positively related to hepatic steatosis**—a finding not previously reported in this population, and (3) **elevations in serum-_free_ testosterone levels are positively associated with hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in transwomen.** Taken together, these data suggest a balance between _free_ testosterone levels, and estradiol may represent an important biomarker in transwomen for cardiometabolic risk."
- "Importantly, we observed that orchiectomy was associated with less liver steatosis and insulin sensitivity, despite cross-sex hormone treatment. Admittedly, the duration, dosage, and timing of cross hormone therapy did differ among our subjects; however, our sample size is small enough that we were unable to power the study adequately to factor in these potential confounding variables."
- "**The ratio of testosterone and estradiol has been proposed as a marker of cardiometabolic health.** In a study by Gong et al. a high testosterone-to-estradiol ratio was associated with cerebrovascular disease. Likewise, Zheng et al. found the testosterone-to-estradiol ratio to be nearly twice higher in men with coronary heart disease, compared to age-matched controls. In our study, we found that transsexual women with an elevated testosterone had the lowest levels of estradiol, resulting in a testosterone-to-estradiol ratio 53 times higher than either of the other two groups, suggesting that **the balance between testosterone and estradiol may be more important than absolute levels of either hormone for cardiometabolic health.**"
## Perspectives and Conclusions
"In this study, we show that (1) **orchiectomy may be metabolically protective** and (2) **the circulating ratio of sex hormones may be a major determinant of metabolic health in transwomen.**"
