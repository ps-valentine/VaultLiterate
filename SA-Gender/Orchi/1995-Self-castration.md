McGovern, S. J. “Case Report: Self-castration in a transsexual.” *Journal of Accident and Emergency Medicine* 12 (1995): 57-58: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1342522/pdf/jaccidem00006-0063.pdf

A case report out of Belfast, Ireland in 1995. As the gentleman reporting on the case misgendered our comrade throughout, I will correct in my quotations without any notation. I also corrected at least two typos, fucking idiot cissexuals; I joke!.. See the original article for more information.
## Introduction
"Deliberate genital self-injury is rare, however, as the waiting times for sex reassignment surgery lengthens we may witness an increase in genital self-mutilation as transsexuals give vent to their frustration. The following case report details the immediate management of one such patient."
## Case Report
- She "said that she was a transsexual and had become 'tired of waiting for surgery, so she had cut off her testes and thrown them away.' She had a pulse of 90 and a blood pressure of 120/90. Examination of the groin region in the A&E department was difficult, however, it was apparent that there were lacerations to both hemi-scrotums. The patient was given a bolus of intravenous fluid and intravenous analgesia."
- "She was taken directly to theatre for exploration of the scrotum."
- "At operation there were two large haematomas in each hemi-scrotum. There were large ragged lacerations to both hemi-scrotums, both spermatic cords had been divided 1 cm distal to the superficial inguinal ring and no testes were present in the scrotum. The spermatic cords were debrided and ligated with 2-0 vicryl, the haematomas were evacuated. The scrotal wounds were debrided and sutured. Drain were left *in-situ*. Intro-operatively it was noted that... \[the patient] passed urine normally and there was no haematuria."
- Preserving some of the transphobic wording here, for historical context... "P.F. had first seen a psychiatrist at age 17 and had thought from the age of 13 that he was a woman in a man's body. P.F. had been prescribed regular oestrogen and cyproterone acetate and had recently undergone breast augmentation surgery. P.F. had been living as a woman for 5 years with her mother who was supportive. She had been waiting for sex reassignment surgery (SRS) for 5 years."
## Discussion
- "Genital self-mutilation is extremely rare. Greilsheimer & Groves reported 14 cases of self castration before 1979... Rana *et al.* described a case of sequential self-castration and amputation of the penis in a transsexual patient..." (see References)
- "People who perform self-castration usually oppose surgical repair of their genitals. P.F. refused to give consent for repair and said that she had thrown them away to ensure that this could not be performed. This is not uncommon among transsexuals who carry out this procedure."
- "The testicular artery is an end artery and although it may bleed extensively initially, vascular spasm usually prevents life-threatening haemorrhage developing. The immediate management of these individuals is fluid resuscitation, analgesia and early exploration of the genital region in theatre. Should there be deep lacerations to the penis then an ascending urogram is indicated."
- "There have been no reported deaths from this procedure in the United Kingdom but should we wait until there are before we expedite definite surgery for those who are properly identified as primary transsexuals?"
