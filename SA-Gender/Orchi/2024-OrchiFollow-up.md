"Gender-affirming orchiectomy in transgender and non-binary individuals: A large cohort study with middle- to long-term follow-up". *International Journal of Transgender Health* **26**, no. 2 (2025), 459-463: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/26895269.2024.2396939#abstract
## Abstract
### Introduction
"Some transgender individuals opt for gender-affirming orchiectomy. Data on postoperative outcomes in the transgender population are scarce."
### Methods
"All individuals who underwent gender-affirming orchiectomy between 01-2010 and 01-2024 were retrospectively identified at two centers that provide surgical transgender care. Individual demographics, motivations, intra- and postoperative complications, reoperations and postoperative regret were recorded. Surgical risk factors were identified using logistic regression analysis."
### Results
"A total of **119 individuals** were retrospectively identified with a median clinical follow-up of 2.3 years (range 0.3–9.4). A total of 109 identified as transgender woman, eight as non-binary and two as agender. 18 (15%) individuals opted for sperm cryopreservation before surgery. The postoperative course was without complications in 102 (86%) individuals. Complications comprised hemorrhage (n = 5, 4%, Clavien-Dindo 3b) and abscess formation (n = 7, 6%, Clavien-Dindo 2), (n = 1), 3a (n = 3) and 3b (n = 3))). In the follow-up time, seven individuals underwent vaginoplasty, two vulvoplasty and two were on the waiting list for vaginoplasty. There were no cases of regret. A BMI >35 was identified as risk factor for infectious complications..."
### Discussion
"Gender-affirming orchiectomy is a simple and safe procedure. It can be performed as standalone gender-affirming surgical procedure, or as bridge to another gender-affirming procedure."
## Introduction

## Methods
### Surgical procedure
See [[2020-OrchiSXGuide|Francis et al.]]
### Chart review
"A retrospective chart study was conducted, recording
    - Individual demographics (self-reported gender identity, age at surgery, BMI at surgery, intoxications, history of smoking, history of puberty suppression, comorbidities, history of mental health issues, sperm cryopreservation before surgery)
    - motivation for gender-affirming orchiectomy
    - intra- and postoperative complications, subcategorized according to the Clavien-Dindo classification of surgical complications
    - reoperations and
    - postoperative regret"

### Surgical outcomes
"The mean surgical duration was 15 ± 4 min. The median clinical follow-up was 2.3 years (range 0.3–9.4). The postoperative course was without complications in 102 (86%) individuals. Complications comprised mainly hemorrhage (n = 5, 4%) and abscess formation (n = 7, 6%). An overview of complications and Clavien–Dindo categorization is presented in Table 2..."

## Discussion
- "Current literature on surgical outcomes after gender-affirming orchiectomy is very scarce. It comprises of a few retrospective cohort studies, one of them by our own research group, with short-term follow-up and a few retrospective database studies with overlapping study time periods (Hana et al.; Russell et al.; Saltman et al.; Van der Sluis et al.). All are of a retrospective nature and have a short-term follow-up period."
	![[2024-OrchiFU-Table3.png]]
- "In this study, 29% of individuals regarded orchiectomy as a standalone gender-affirming procedure and did not wish to undergo vulvoplasty or vaginoplasty because of lack of genital dysphoria. A total of 39% of individuals regarded orchiectomy as a preceding step to (possible) future vaginoplasty. Within the study time period, four of them actually underwent a vaginoplasty procedure. This group should be informed that when they have a vaginoplasty procedure, there is a higher risk of needing additional skin grafts (Sineath et al.)."
- "Obesity and transgender surgery is a controversial topic. Many surgical centers have institutional requirements with regard to BMI for specific procedures, for instance vaginoplasty. However, these requirements are frequently not based on empirical evidence (Brownstone et al.; Linsenmeyer & Garwood). In this study, a total of 16% of individuals that underwent gender-affirming orchiectomy actually desired a vaginoplasty or vulvoplasty procedure but did not meet institutional BMI requirements for this. This means that these requirements affect the surgical path of the individual and may be seen as a barrier for surgical care. However, in this study, a BMI >35 was identified as risk factor for infectious complications after gender-affirming orchiectomy. Therefore, obese individuals should be well-informed about possible risks of surgery."
- "Strengths of this study are the relatively large number of included individuals, the completeness of data and the middle- to long-term follow-up time. Weaknesses of this study comprise the retrospective nature and the lack of self-reported outcomes."
