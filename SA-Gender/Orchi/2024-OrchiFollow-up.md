"Gender-affirming orchiectomy in transgender and non-binary individuals: A large cohort study with middle- to long-term follow-up". *International Journal of Transgender Health* **26**, no. 2 (2025), 459-463: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/26895269.2024.2396939#abstract
## Abstract
### Introduction
"Some transgender individuals opt for gender-affirming orchiectomy. Data on postoperative outcomes in the transgender population are scarce."
### Methods
"All individuals who underwent gender-affirming orchiectomy between 01-2010 and 01-2024 were retrospectively identified at two centers that provide surgical transgender care. Individual demographics, motivations, intra- and postoperative complications, reoperations and postoperative regret were recorded. Surgical risk factors were identified using logistic regression analysis."
### Results
"A total of **119 individuals** were retrospectively identified with a median clinical follow-up of 2.3 years (range 0.3–9.4). A total of 109 identified as transgender woman, eight as non-binary and two as agender. 18 (15%) individuals opted for sperm cryopreservation before surgery. The postoperative course was without complications in 102 (86%) individuals. Complications comprised hemorrhage (n = 5, 4%, Clavien-Dindo 3b) and abscess formation (n = 7, 6%, Clavien-Dindo 2), (n = 1), 3a (n = 3) and 3b (n = 3))). In the follow-up time, seven individuals underwent vaginoplasty, two vulvoplasty and two were on the waiting list for vaginoplasty. There were no cases of regret. A BMI >35 was identified as risk factor for infectious complications..."
### Discussion
"Gender-affirming orchiectomy is a simple and safe procedure. It can be performed as standalone gender-affirming surgical procedure, or as bridge to another gender-affirming procedure."
## Introduction

## Methods
### Surgical procedure
See [[2020-OrchiSXGuide|Francis et al.]]
### Chart review
"A retrospective chart study was conducted, recording
    - Individual demographics (self-reported gender identity, age at surgery, BMI at surgery, intoxications, history of smoking, history of puberty suppression, comorbidities, history of mental health issues, sperm cryopreservation before surgery)
    - motivation for gender-affirming orchiectomy
    - intra- and postoperative complications, subcategorized according to the Clavien-Dindo classification of surgical complications
    - reoperations and
    - postoperative regret"

### Surgical outcomes
"The mean surgical duration was 15 ± 4 min. The median clinical follow-up was 2.3 years (range 0.3–9.4). The postoperative course was without complications in 102 (86%) individuals. Complications comprised mainly hemorrhage (n = 5, 4%) and abscess formation (n = 7, 6%). An overview of complications and Clavien–Dindo categorization is presented in Table 2..."
