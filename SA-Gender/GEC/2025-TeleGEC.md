## Abstract and Figures
- "Transgender and gender diverse individuals often face challenges with social aspects of transition despite access to conventional gender-affirming medical and surgical treatments. Gender Expression Care (GEC) addresses this by offering practical and immediate support led by interdisciplinary professionals in a small-group workshop series. Participants receive guidance in voice and movement, communication strategies, wardrobe styling, and cosmetic techniques in order to more safely and confidently align their outward presentation with their gender identity."
- "During the COVID-19 pandemic, GEC was rapidly adapted from an in-person to a virtual format. This study aims to describe that transition, using descriptive statistics and a qualitative thematic approach to explore the experience of 261 participants."
	- "Telemedicine improved access to GEC, expanding from 24 unique zip codes concentrated in one major urban area for workshops held in-person, to 158 zip codes spanning a wide geographic region for workshops held virtually... In addition, this format eliminated the financial burden of travel, facilitating participation by members from various socioeconomic backgrounds. Telemedicine is a suitable format to help transitioning individuals develop their own authentic gender expression while building social connection beyond traditional geographic boundaries."
	- "Satisfaction was high, with 89% of participants reporting a good, very good, or excellent experience virtually."
