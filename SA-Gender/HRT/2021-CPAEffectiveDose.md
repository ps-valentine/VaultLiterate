An exploration of lowest effective cyproterone acetate (CPA) dose in trans women to achieve results while minimizing side effects.
## Abstract
### Context
"Cyproterone acetate (CPA) is a competitive inhibitor of the androgen receptor and exerts negative hypothalamic feedback. It is often used in combination with estrogens in trans women to achieve feminization. However, CPA has been associated with side effects such as changes in liver enzyme concentrations and increases in prolactin concentrations. The question is whether the testosterone-lowering effect, as well as these side effects, are dose dependent."
### Objective
"To assess the lowest effective dose of CPA in trans women to prevent side effects."
### Methods
This study was conducted at gender identity centers in three cities in the Netherlands and "is part of the European Network for the Investigation of Gender Incongruence (ENIGI), a multicenter prospective cohort study. Participants were trans women (n = 882) using estrogens only or in combination with 10, 25, 50, or 100 mg CPA daily. The primary outcome measure. was the concentration of testosterone at 3 and/or 12 months of hormone therapy."
### Results
- "All doses of CPA resulted in testosterone concentrations below the predefined threshold of suppression of 2 nmol/L..."
- "Higher prolactin and lower high-density lipoprotein concentrations were observed with increasing doses of CPA. No differences in liver enzyme concentrations were found between the doses."
### Conclusion
"Compared with higher doses of CPA, **a daily dose of 10 mg is equally effective in lowering testosterone concentrations in trans women, while showing fewer side effects.**"
## Introduction
- "A widely used anti-androgen in Europe is cyproterone acetate (CPA). The anti-androgenic effects of CPA are mainly caused by competitively blocking the androgen receptor... Furthermore, CPA has an anti-gonadotropic effect causing a decrease in the secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). As CPA is a progestogen, it also shows progestogen-like effects, such as changes in lipid metabolism."
- "Historically, CPA has been used in the treatment of prostate cancer, hypersexuality, and hirsutism. The first studies on effects of CPA in trans women were published in the 1980s by [[1989-TSMortality+Morbidity|Asscheman et al]] and [[1988-EstrogenProlactinoma|Gooren et al.]] After CPA was introduced in trans women, serious health concerns were raised regarding increases in prolactin concentrations, changes in liver enzymes, changes in lipid concentrations, and increases in the prevalence of thrombosis. Recently, concerns have been raised about the development of meningiomas in long-term use of high cumulative doses of CPA."
- "Besides treatment with CPA, **other anti-androgen treatment options** for trans women **include the use of spironolactone and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists.**"
- "A recent study by Pappas et al showed that **spironolactone in combination with high doses** (ie, median dose of 6 mg/day) **of estrogens** resulted in suppressed testosterone concentrations. However, no data have been presented on the side effects of these high doses of estrogens. At initiation of spironolactone use and with subsequent dose alterations potassium checks are recommended. Therefore, use of spironolactone needs to be monitored more closely. However, opposite to CPA, spironolactone as an adjunct anti-androgen agent has not been associated with increases in prolactin concentrations."
- "**GnRH agonists** initially raise the concentrations of LH and FSH. Over time, however, the overstimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis leads to decreases in LH and FSH concentrations, subsequently leading to a decline in testosterone concentrations. Unfortunately, unlike CPA and spironolactone, the route of administration of GnRH agonists is through subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, and data on the long-term safety of their use are limited. However long-term safety in patients with precocious puberty or prostate cancer has been researched."
- "Because of the raised concerns, centers are increasingly choosing to switch from CPA to GnRH agonists as the first treatment choice. In the United States, CPA has never been licensed for any indication. In the United Kingdom, GnRH agonists are treatment of first choice and are widely reimbursed. At the beginning of 2020, a safety report on CPA was published by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on the risk of meningiomas with use of CPA, and the restriction of CPA was suggested in situations where alternative treatment options are available. The EMA additionally called for the lowest possible effective dose of CPA to be used if CPA treatment was maintained."
- Over time, average CPA dosage has been reduced; previously, it was commonly prescribed at 100 mg QD, but not, 10 mg QD is a more typical dose.
## Methods
### Study Population
"Data collection started in 2010 and is ongoing. The study was set up to describe the clinical effects and side effects of specific forms of HT... Participants were included from 2010 to March 2020. Individuals who had undergone an orchiectomy or had previously used HT prior to the initiation of HT were excluded from this study. Additionally, individuals with suppressed serum testosterone concentrations at baseline (defined as testosterone concentrations below 2 nmol/L) were excluded."
### Treatment Protocol
"At the beginning of this study, the starting dose of CPA was 100 mg. This dose was reduced over time in steps to, respectively, 50 mg, 25 mg, and 10 mg. If the preferred dose of a participant was lower than the standard dose dictated by the protocol used at that time, the preferred dose was used. The follow-up consisted of clinical visits every 3 months in the first year."
### Data Collection
- "Blood was drawn at start of the HT, as well as after 3 months and after 12 months of HT. The serum measurements taken included testosterone, estradiol, prolactin, aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoproteins cholesterol (HDL-C), total cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations."
- "Information related to the occurrence of thrombosis and meningiomas in the first 12 months of HT was collected. Each participant’s body mass index (BMI) was calculated using measured height and weight with light indoor clothes but no shoes at clinical visits."
### Primary and Secondary Outcomes
"The primary outcome of this study was the concentration of testosterone with different CPA doses, measured at 3 and/or 12 months. The secondary outcome was a comparison of the CPA doses in relation to percentages of participants with suppressed testosterone and hyperprolactinemia. Furthermore, a comparison was made between the different doses of CPA and participants’ prolactin concentrations, liver enzyme concentrations, lipid concentrations, and the occurrence of thrombosis and meningiomas."

### Changes in CPA Doses
"The high number of participants who had a dose reduction from 50 mg to 25 mg can be explained by a change in protocol in 2017."
### Primary Results
### Secondary Results
#### Testosterone suppression
"After start of HT, the odds of having a suppressed testosterone concentration were higher with all doses of CPA compared with use of no CPA (ie, only estrogens). No difference was observed among different doses of CPA. At 3 and 12 months of HT, 46.3% of participants using no CPA had suppressed testosterone, whereas this percentage was higher in participants using 10 mg (92.3%), 25 mg (96.2%), 50 mg (93.4%), and 100 mg (100.0%) of CPA."
#### Prolactin concentrations
"At 3 and 12 months of HT, none of the participants who did not use CPA had prolactin concentrations above the reference ranges. These percentages were higher in participants using 10 mg (9.1%), 25 mg (11.7%), 50 mg (13.8%), and 100 mg (14.3%) of CPA."
#### Liver enzymes
"No relevant differences were found between the doses of CPA and the concentrations of AST, GGT, and ALP. Mean concentrations of liver enzymes remained within the reference range among all different doses of CPA."
#### Lipid concentrations
"No relevant differences were found between doses of CPA and concentrations of LDL-C, total cholesterol, or triglycerides. Mean lipid concentrations remained within the reference range among all different doses of CPA."
#### Thrombosis and meningiomas
"In this cohort, 1 participant had a superficial venous thrombosis between 9 and 12 months of follow-up. No underlying clotting deficiencies could be found. This participant used 50 mg of CPA in combination with 4 mg of estradiol valerate per day. Furthermore, 1 participant was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism between 3 and 12 months of follow-up. This 62-year-old participant with an extensive medical history used 25 mg of CPA and 50 mcg of transdermal estradiol at 3 months... None of the participants were diagnosed with a meningioma."
## Discussion
- "In this cohort study of 882 trans women using estrogens, we investigated testosterone concentrations when successively tapering the dose of CPA over the last decade. In the current study, serum testosterone concentrations were equally suppressed among all different doses of CPA. With regard to side effects, CPA doses above 10 mg resulted in higher prolactin concentrations and lower HDL-C concentrations. Among different doses of CPA, no differences were observed in concentrations of liver enzymes or blood lipids."
- "In the first year of study inclusion, a few participants received a dose of 100 mg of CPA. Shortly thereafter, in-hospital protocol changed to 50 mg of CPA. As more health concerns related to CPA use were raised over the years, the dose was further lowered from 50 mg to 25 mg and, finally, to 10 mg. However, due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, limited results from participants with 10 mg of CPA were available for analysis."
- "The documented effects on testosterone concentrations are in line with those of an earlier study by Fung et al, which was performed in a smaller cohort on participants using 25 mg and 50 mg of CPA. They showed that 25 mg of CPA was just as effective as 50 mg of CPA in lowering testosterone concentrations. Our study showed that the same accounts for the testosterone-lowering effects of 10 mg of CPA."
### Strengths and Limitations
## Conclusion
"...10 mg of CPA was found to be effective in lowering testosterone concentrations to the range observed in cis women. A dose of 10 mg was equally effective as higher doses, was found to have less influence on prolactin concentrations, and allowed higher HDL-C concentrations to be maintained. While GnRH agonists are preferred over CPA due to the fewer associated long-term side effects, this study shows that CPA at a low dose is a viable option when GnRH agonists are contraindicated, not available, or not reimbursed."
