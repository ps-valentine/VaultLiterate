# Mortality and morbidity in transsexual patients with cross-gender hormone treatment
Asscheman, H., L. J. G. Gooren, P. L. E. Eklund. "Mortality and morbidity in transsexual patients with cross-gender hormone treatment." *Metabolism* 38, no. 9 (1989): 869-873, [https://www.hemingways.org/GIDinfo/Mortality_Study.pdf]()
## Background
- "The number of deaths and morbidity cases in 425 transsexual patients treated with cross- gender hormones were evaluated retrospectively and compared with the expected number in a similar reference group of the  population. The number of deaths in male-to-female transsexuals was five times the number expected, due to increased numbers of suicide and death of unknown cause. "
- "Combined treatment with estrogen and cyproterone acetate in 303 male-to-female transsexuals was associated with a 45-fold increase of thromboembolic events, hyperprolactinemia (400-fold), depressive mood changes (15-fold), and transient elevation of liver enzymes."
- "Androgen treatment in 122 female-to- male transsexuals was associated with weight increase >10% (17.2%) and acne (12.3%)."
- "Explanation of possible side effects and careful clinical judgment remain the cornerstone of the clinical decision to prescribe cross- gender hormones. Furthermore, follow up of this relatively young population to disclose long-term side effects and to elucidate the association of sex steroids with coronary heart disease, as well as efforts to reduce the risk of thromboembolic events, are required... Ideally, the given hormone treatment should suppress the secondary sex characteristics of the original sex, as well as induce those of the opposite sex to the fullest extent and in the shortest possible period of time. Therefore, there is an inclination to maximize hormone dosage, which may involve health hazards"
## Materials and Methods
- "The files of all patients seen in our outpatient department between 1972 and 1986 were reviewed..." for diagnosis of transsexualism. "There were files of 558 patients with a problem of gender dysphoria, of whom 425 were included in this study. Reasons for exclusion of the others were as follows: no hormonal treatment (n = 71), only antiandrogen treatment (n = 6), failure to comply with our follow-up schedule (n = 15), no data available (n = 10), and treatment either not yet started or for less than six months (n = 31). The population included in this analysis comprised 303 male-to-female and 122 female-to-male transsexuals."
- "Our standard hormone treatment regimen in male- to-female transsexuals consisted of 100 mg cyproterone acetate and 100 mg ethinylestradiol/ day orally (n = 258). Until 1980 diethylstilbestrol (5 to 15 mg/d) was prescribed for a few patients. Some patients insisted on parenteral estrogen therapy. They procured the estrogens outside our clinic and these were self-administered in a dose of 200 to 800 mg estradiol-17- undecanoate/month in (n = 45). Recommended dose of parenteral estrogens in postmenopausal women is 20 to 100 mg/m."
- "In female-to-male patients long-acting testosterone esters 250 mg im every 2 weeks (n = 69) or testosterone undecanoate 120 to 160 mg/d orally (n = 19), or both, but not simultaneously (n = 34), were prescribed. If menstrual activity did not cease within three months after start of the hormone administration, an oral progestin, lynestrol 5 mg/d, was added (n = 3)."
