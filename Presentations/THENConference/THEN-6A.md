#### Transmasculine Spectrum
- Why? Exogenous testosterone suppresses HPG axis → decreased or no estrogen production → loss of vaginal epithelial cells.

	- Vaginal dryness & irritation
	- Pain with penetration
	- Sometimes bleeding with sex, itching, pain with exercise, or tenderness
	- Co-occurring urinary symptoms, including incontinence and mirroring UTIs
- Treatment

- Can include many symptoms...

	- Hematuria
