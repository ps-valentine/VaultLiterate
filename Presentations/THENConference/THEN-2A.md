Participants will learn about the necessity for culturally competent and inclusive support for trans and nonbinary individuals in areas such as recreation, personal style, and peer support."
## Who am i?
## Purpose of the presentation (the CE version)
## Purpose of the presentation (the candid version)
- To show the ways that queer and trans people are working together in our community to meet one another's social/emotional needs.
## Minority stress/trans mental health
- TGNC individuals report significantly higher levels of anxiety (26-38% vs. 28.8% in the general population) and depression (48-62% vs. 16.6% in the general population).
- Loneliness was significantly higher among trans people than cist people (56.4% for trans women, 62.6% for trans men, 63.9% for GNC, compared to 32.1% for cis people).
## Data in support of social support
- Encourages us to use healthy coping mechanisms, reduces psychological distress, and predicts posit5vie mental and physical health outcomes.
## Social support and internalized transphobia
## Trauma-informed lens (Hall, 2021)
- Trans/NB people have increased risk of PTSD and higher trauma exposure.
- This study gathered qualitative data on how trans and gender expansive people feel about MH and community support and what they feel would improve these things.
- "Think about the communities to which you belong. What qualities would make these communities more supportive of you in the future?"
	- Trust and emotional safety
		- Preferences for working with other members of the LGBTQ+ community
		- Mindfulness around ingroup gender policing
		- Acceptance and validation especially important for those healing from trauma
	- Physically safe and accessible spaces
	- Choice and collaboration
	- Empowerment

### Jasmine Angelini-Knoll: Data in support of sports
- Lack of inclusive/comfortable environments are the primary barrier to trans participation in sports
- Trans adults are less likely to engage in physical activity in their free time, largely due to peer victimization in gyms/community sports
- Higher perceived social support predicts greater activity levels and lower depressive symptoms
- Participants who play sports or have regular gym routines report better coping skills and lower internalized stigma
- Avoiding sports due to anticipated discrimination is connected to higher levels of depression
- Social support and self-perception are mediators of physical activity
