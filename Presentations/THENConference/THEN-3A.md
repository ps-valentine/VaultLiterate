# A Hermeneutic Photography Study of Trans Women and Trans femme Geeks' Queer Joy
Corrine Buchanan (she/her), Ph.D., LMHC, LMFT, NCC

"This presentation draws from my dissertation, A Hermeneutic Photography Study of Trans Women and Trans Femme Geeks’ Queer Joy, to explore how joy functions as a healing and identity-affirming force within marginalized communities. Using photography and narrative, the study illuminates the lived experiences of trans women and trans femme geeks, highlighting how creativity, fandom, and community foster resilience and belonging."
## Objectives
## What is Hermeneutic Photography?
"**Hermeneutic photography** is a qualitative research methodology to explore meaning-making in the world using interviews and photos from participants (Hagedorn, 1994)."
## What is queer joy?
"**Queer joy** is a part of an epistemological framework which argues what when research only asks particular kinds of questions then they receive the same kinds of answers, limiting insight and re-perpetuating narrow views of marginalized communities (Henricks, 2016; Shuster & Westbrook, 2022).

Queer joy is about the joyful experiences that queer people live into which sustains them in the face of oppression (Shuster & Westbrook, 2022)."
