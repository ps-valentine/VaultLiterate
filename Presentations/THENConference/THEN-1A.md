# Towards Gender Euphoria: Emphasizing Wellness in Gender-Affirming Care
**Presenter:** Sasha Cohen (they/he), FNP-C, AAHIVS

"This presentation aims to imagine a framework for providing gender-affirming care that centers fostering wellness in TGNB patients rather than the more traditional pathology-based models that have been prevalent. In order to understand how our current model of GAC developed we will explore the historical roots of this care and the evolution of GAC over time. The presentation will encourage clinicians to examine their ethos in approaching this work and commit to empowering their TGNB patients on their transition journey."
## Historical Foundations of Gender-Affirming Care: Returning to an Indigenous Perspective
- Gender variance is not new! Gender variant individuals are often viewed with reverence as important religious/spiritual figures in indigenous cultures. Binary notions of gender and sexuality are Western, Judeo-Christian constructs, which were forced upon native communities with the expansion of European colonialism around the globe.
- 18th & 19th centuries: shift toward binaristic view of gender.
- late 19th & 20th centuries: western medical & psychiatric professionals begin noticing the 'transgender phenomenon'
