# Somatic Support for Bodies in Transition
Zoë Poulette

"Somatics offers a different kind of lens into trans embodiment: the first-person perspective. By definition, trans people sense things that transcend standardized categories, and somatics is about supporting that emergence. What becomes possible when we view the body not as singular thing that can be charted and categorized, but as a collection of psycho, social, and historical forces? This presentation will provide a brief overview of the field of somatics, practical applications for trans clients, simple ways to incorporate a "somatic view" into any healthcare practice, and a brief example of a somatic practice for participants to experience."

### Gender Embodiment

### Somatics
- Bringing unconscious patterns, feelings, and beliefs into conscious awareness so that we can move and exist with more choicefulness.
