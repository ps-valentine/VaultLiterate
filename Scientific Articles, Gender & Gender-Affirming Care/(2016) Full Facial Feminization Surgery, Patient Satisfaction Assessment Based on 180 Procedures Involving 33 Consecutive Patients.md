Raffaini, Mirco, Alica Sara Magri, and Tommaso Agostini. “Full Facial Feminization Surgery: Patient Satisfaction Assessment Based on 180 Procedures Involving 33 Consecutive Patients.” Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery 137, no. 2 (2016): 438-448, [https://journals.lww.com/plasreconsurg/fulltext/2016/02000/full_facial_feminization_surgery__patient.11.aspx](https://journals.lww.com/plasreconsurg/fulltext/2016/02000/full_facial_feminization_surgery__patient.11.aspx) 

Discusses some hallmarks of conventionally ‘masculine’ or ‘feminine’ features, a proposed flowchart for facial gender confirmation surgeries (FGCS) (including a two-stage process), a list of procedures that might be involved in FGCS, and self-reported satisfaction measures from patients who underwent gender-affirming surgery. The two-stage process described for the flow of facial gender confirmation surgeries contrasts to an all-in-one approach to FGCS, with each having its strengths and weaknesses; the all-in-one approach is not discussed at length in this article.
