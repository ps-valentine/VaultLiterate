Johnson, Sterline and Kimberley L. Sue. “Drawing on Black and Queer Communities’ Harm Reduction Histories to Improve Overdose Prevention Strategies and Policies.” *AMA Journal of Ethics* 26, no. 7 (2024): e580-586, https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/drawing-black-and-queer-communities-harm-reduction-histories-improve-overdose-prevention-strategies/2024-07
- "Harm reduction emerged as a set of strategies developed by and for people who use opioids and other substances and strive to do so in ways that are as safe as possible. This article reviews histories of Black and queer community-based harm reduction practices and suggests how these histories can inform harm reduction policy and guide development and implementation of anti-overdose interventions."
