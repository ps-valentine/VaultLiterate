Johnson, Sterline and Kimberley L. Sue. “Drawing on Black and Queer Communities’ Harm Reduction Histories to Improve Overdose Prevention Strategies and Policies.” *AMA Journal of Ethics* 26, no. 7 (2024): e580-586, https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/drawing-black-and-queer-communities-harm-reduction-histories-improve-overdose-prevention-strategies/2024-07
- **Abstract**: "Harm reduction emerged as a set of strategies developed by and for people who use opioids and other substances and strive to do so in ways that are as safe as possible. This article reviews histories of Black and queer community-based harm reduction practices and suggests how these histories can inform harm reduction policy and guide development and implementation of anti-overdose interventions."
- "**Harm reduction**... is also a philosophy and practice born of people's lived experience of structural violence arising from the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the late 1980s."
- "**Harm reduction** must be seen as an evolving and emergent set of strategies that can be utilized and adapted by people who use drugs or engage in sex work; to prevent harms associated with these practices, public health officers and medical professionals must work in tandem with local communities to implement harm reduction interventions and promote harm reduction policies."
- "...more than 110,000 overdose deaths in the... 12-month period ending August 2023 - largely due to the rise of illicitly manufactured fentanyl in the unregulated drug supply."
