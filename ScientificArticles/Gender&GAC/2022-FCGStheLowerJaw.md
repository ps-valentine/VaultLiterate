An overview of ‘lower-third’ FGCS procedures, focused on transfeminine patients with some minimal discussion of masculinizing procedures. Includes extensive operative photographs, a useful jaw surgery chart with 3D CT scans, before & after photographs, and an assessment of patient satisfaction and self-perceived femininity. Also, some discussion of surgical imaging & guides that are useful in FGCS.
