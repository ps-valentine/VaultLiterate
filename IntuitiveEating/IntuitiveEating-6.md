# *Intuitive Eating*
by Evelyn Tribole & Elyse Resch, 2020, 4th ed.
### Chapter 6, Principle 1: Reject the Diet Mentality
- "Dieting is often the *trigger* for overeating." (64)
#### The Diet Void
- "For many people dieting has been a way to cope with life, from filling up time, to serving as a symbol of control over your life." (65)
- "There's a social element to dieting that you may miss, *diet bonding*. When you decide to give up dieting, you might be surprised how often new diets and dieting are the topi of conversation at parties, with friends, at work - and now you won't be playing *that* game." (65-66)
#### The One-Last Diet Trap
- "To get yourself out of the last-chance-diet trap, you need to come to terms with the fact that dieting doesn't work and can, in fact, be harmful." (67)
- "... studies have shown that improvements in psychological well-being associated with weight loss are just as temporary as the pounds lost and regained. The 'good feelings' diminish with regained weight, and existing issues of self-worth and general psychological function return to initial levels when the weight is regained." (67)
#### Pseudo-Dieting
- "The problem is that dieting thoughts usually translate into diet-like behaviors, which becomes *pseudo-dieting* or unconscious dieting. Consequently, these clients will still suffer the side effects of dieting, but it's much harder to spot (and then they really feel out of control with their eating). *Pseudo-dieting* behaviors are not usually apparent to the person engaged in them." (68)
- *Intuitive Eating* includes a bunch of examples, though I will not list all of them here...
	- "*Pacifying hunger by drinking coffee or diet soda.* This is a common dieting trick to assuage hunger pangs without eating or calories." (69)
	- "*Putting on a 'false food face' in public.* You only eat what is "proper" in front of other people - this is also known as performative eating, eating to please the expectations of others." (69)
#### The Dieter's Dilemma
- "The inherent futility of dieting is explained in the Dieter's Dilemma model created by psychologists John P. Foreyt and G. Ken Goodrick..." (70) and included in their book *Living Without Dieting* (1992).
- (ADD DIAGRAM?)
#### How to Reject the Diet Mentality
- "Several researchers and health professionals are calling for a paradigm shift away from weight-focused healthcare..." (72)
