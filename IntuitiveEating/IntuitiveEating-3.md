# Intuitive Eating
by Evelyn Tribole & Elyse Resch, 2020, 4th ed. 
### Chapter 3: What Kind of Eater Are You?
- "Perhaps you are still dieting and don't know it! There are many types of eating styles that are actually unconscious forms of dieting," or "some form of food restriction with the goal of shrinking the body." (31)
#### The Eating Personalities
##### The Careful Clean Eater
- "Careful eaters are those who tend to be vigilant about what foods they put into their bodies." (33)
###### Eating Style.
- "Careful Clean Eaters tend to be very rigid and monitor the quantity and quality of food eaten... While the Careful Clean Eater is not officially on a diet, their mind is..." (33)
###### The Problem.
- "There's nothing wrong with being interested in the well-being of your body. The problem occurs when diligent (bordering on militant) eating affects a healthy relationship with food – and negatively impacts your body. The problem is rigidity." (34)
##### The Professional Dieter
###### Eating Style.
- "Professional Dieters also have careful eating traits. The difference is that chronic dieters guide every eating choice for the sake of losing weight. Often in the guise of health..." (34)
###### The Problem.
- "It's hard to live this way. Chronic undereating usually results in overeating or periodic binges." (35)
- "While anorexia and bulimia are multifactorial and rooted in psychological issues (and many other issues – genetic, societal, familial, and so on), a growing body of research has demonstrated that chronic dieting is a common stepping-stone to an eating disorder." (35)
##### The Unconscious Eater
- "The Unconscious Eater is often engaged in paired eating – which is eating and doing another activity at the same time... Because of the subtleties, and lack of awareness, it can be difficult for a person to identify this eating personality. There are many subtypes of unconscious eater." (35)
###### The Chaotic Unconscious Eater.
###### The Refuse-Not Unconscious Eater.
###### The Waste-Not Unconscious Eater.
###### The Emotional Unconscious Eater.
###### The Problem.
- "...is a problem if it results in chronic overeating (which can easily occur when you are eating and not quite aware of it).
     Keep in mind that somewhere between the first and last bite of food is where the lapse of consciousness takes place... It's zoning out with food." (36-37)
#### When Your Eating Personality Works Against You
- "...the biological effects of dieting (as detailed in chapter 6) make it increasingly difficult to have a normal relationship with food." (37)
#### Introducing the Intuitive Eater
- "Intuitive Eaters march to their inner hunger signals and eat whatever they choose in a satisfying way, without experiencing guilt or an ethical dilemma." (37)
- "Toddlers have innate wisdom about food, if you don't interfere with it. They don't eat based on dieting rules or health, yet study after study shows that if you let a toddler eat spontaneously, they will eat what they need when given free access to food." (37-38)
- "A parent who feeds a baby whenever a hunger signal is heard and who stops feeding when the baby shows that they've had enough can play a powerful role in the initial development of Intuitive Eating. It's one of the reasons we are so excited about baby-led weaning (see chapter 16)." (38)
- "Fortunately, we all, for the most part, possess the natural Intuitive Eating ability; it's just been suppressed, especially by dieting." (39)
#### How Your Intuitive Eating Gets Buried
##### Dieting.
##### Eat-Healthy-or-Die Messages.
- "A 2015 Harris Poll of more than two thousands Americans found that nearly eight out of ten women and seven out of ten men in the United States suffer from food guilt." (40)
