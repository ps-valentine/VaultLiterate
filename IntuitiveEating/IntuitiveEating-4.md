### Chapter 4: Principles of Intuitive Eating: Overview
- "By following the ten principles of Intuitive Eating, you will normalize and heal your relationship with food. And, please keep in mind that these ten principles are simply guidelines and not new rules that can be turned into a new diet. Any desire for weight loss must be put on the back burner, or it will sabotage your process of healing your relationship with food, your mind, and your body. Intuitive Eating is an inside job – it's about listening to the messages of the body through interoceptive awareness." (45)
#### Principle 1: Reject the Diet Mentality
- "Get angry at diet culture that promotes weight loss and the lies that have led you to feel as if you were a failure every time a new diet stopped working and you gain backed all of the weight. If you allow even one small hope to linger that a new and better diet or food plan might be lurking around the corner, it will prevent you from being free to rediscover Intuitive Eating." (46)
#### Principle 2: Honor Your Hunger
- "Keep your body biologically fed with adequate energy and carbohydrates. Otherwise you can trigger a primal drive to overeat. Once you reach the moment of excessive hunger, all intentions of moderate, conscious eating are fleeting and irrelevant. Learning to honor this first biological signal sets the stage for rebuilding trust in yourself and in food." (46)
#### Principle 3: Make Peace with Food
- "Give yourself unconditional permission to eat. If you tell yourself that you can't or shouldn't have a particular food, it can lead to intense feelings of deprivation that build into uncontrollable cravings and, often, bingeing." (47)
#### Principle 4: Challenge the Food Police
- "The food police monitor the unreasonable rules that diet culture has created. The police station is housed deep in your psyche, and its loudspeaker shouts negative barbs, hopeless phrases, and guilt-provoking indictments. Chasing the food police away is a critical step in returning to Intuitive Eating." (48)
#### Principle 5: Discover the Satisfaction Factor
- "In our compulsion to comply with diet culture, we often overlook one of the most basic gifts of existence – the pleasure and satisfaction that can be found in the eating experience. When you eat what you really want, in an environment that is inviting, the pleasure you derive will be a powerful force in helping you feel satisfied and content." (49)
#### Principle 6: Feel Your Fullness
- "In order to honor your fullness, you need to trust that you will give yourself the foods that you desire. Listen for the body signals that tell you that you are no longer hungry and observe the signs that show that you're comfortably full. Pause in the middle of eating and ask yourself how the food tastes, and what your current hunger level is." (50)
#### Principle 7: Cope with Your Emotions with Kindness
-  "First, recognize the food restriction, both physically and mentally, can, in and of itself, trigger loss of control, which can feel like emotional eating. Find kind ways to comfort, nurture, distract, and resolve your issues. Anxiety, loneliness, boredom, and anger are emotions we all experience throughout life. Each has its own trigger, and each has its own appeasement. Food won't fix any of these feelings. It may comfort for the short term, distract from the pain, or even numb you. But food won't solve the problem. You'll ultimately have to deal with the source of the emotion." (51)
- "But they soon learned to savor the foods they had chosen, eat in an inviting environment, and honor their biological hungers. Increased gratifying eating experiences allowed each to let go of using food as a coping mechanism. These experiences also offered clarity – it was easier to distinguish an eating urge from an emotional urge." (51)
#### Principle 8: Respect Your Body
- "...respect your body so you an feel better about who you are. It's hard to reject the diet mentality if you are unrealistic and critical of your body size or shape. All bodies deserve dignity." (52)
#### Principle 9: Movement – Feel the Difference
- "Forget militant exercise. Just get active and feel the difference. Shift your focus to how it feels to move your body, rather than the calorie-burning effect of exercise. If you focus on how you feel from working out, such as energized, it can make the difference between rolling out of bed for a brisk morning walk or hitting the snooze alarm." (53)
- "Part of the problem was that when she was underfeeding her body (dieting), she had little energy, if any, to exercise – and that does not feel good." (53)
#### Principle 10: Honor Your Health – Gentle Nutrition
- "Make food choices that honor your health and taste buds while making you feel good. Remember that you don't have to eat perfectly to be healthy. You will not suddenly get a nutrient deficiency or become unhealthy from one snack, one meal, or one day of eating. It's what you eat consistently over time that matters. Progress, not perfection, is what counts." (54)
