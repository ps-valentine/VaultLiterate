### Intuitive Eating, Chapter 2: Hitting Diet Bottom 
#### Symptoms of Diet Backlash
- "***Diet backlash*** is the cumulative side effect of dieting (or some type of food restriction for the purpose of shrinking your body) -- it can be short term or chronic, depending on how long a person has been dieting." (19)
- Other symptoms of diet backlash include...
    - "The mere contemplation of going on a diet brings on urges and cravings...
    - Upon ending a diet, going on a food binge and feeling guilty...
    - Having little trust in yourself with food...
    - Feeling that you don't deserve to eat...
    - Shortened dieting duration...
    - The Last Supper...
    - Social withdrawal...
    - Sluggish metabolism...
    - Using caffeine to survive the day...
    - Eating disorders..." (20-21)
- "Each diet teaches the body to adapt better for the next self-imposed famine (another diet). Metabolism slows as the body efficiently utilizes each calorie as if it's the last. The more drastic the diet, the more it pushes the body into the calorie-pinching survival mode... Similarly, to fuel metabolism, we must eat a sufficient amount of calories, or our bodies will compensate and slow down. Part of that compensation is that the body will cannibalize its own muscle tissue to use as an energy source (as it has the ability to convert amino acids from the muscle protein into glucose through a process called gluconeogenesis)." (20-21)
- "Coffee and diet drinks are often abused as management tools to feel energetic, while being underfed." (21)
- "Research shows that 35 percent of dieters will progress into disordered eating, and 30 to 45 percent of those dieters will progress into a full eating disorder (Shisslak and Crago 1995)." (21)
#### The Dieting Paradox
##### Medicalization and the Politics of Body Weight
- "Up until the early 2000s the pursuit of shrinking your body was primarily in the purview of the beauty and fitness industries. But that changed with these key political events:
	- In 2002 President Bush proclaimed the war on fat...
	- In 2010 Michelle Obama launched a campaign to solve the 'epidemic' of childhood 'obesity'…
	- In 2013 the American Medical Association voted against its own scientific committee to declare the 'obesity' is a disease..." (22)
- " There is a body of research that shows that food restriction for the purpose of weight loss is not effective in the long run, not sustainable, and moreover causes harm – even if it's prescribed by a physician or dietitian!" (22)
- **The Semmelweis reflex** "...is the rejection of new evidence because it contradicts established norms, beliefs, or paradigms. This cultural reflex is named after the physician who discovered that patients' lives could be saved if doctors washed their hands. But Dr. Semmelweis was summarily dismissed and scoffed at by his medical colleagues for his preposterous idea! He was later proven right, after his death." (23)
##### Advertisements
- "A study published in Eating Disorders: The Journal of Treatment and Prevention in 1993 found that between 1973 and 1991 commercials for dieting aids... increased nearly linearly." (23)
- "In the United States alone, nearly half of Americans are dieting (Mundell 2018)." (23)
##### Media
- "Here's what our nation has to show for dieting and weight stigma...
    - Eating disorders are on the rise. The prevalence of eating disorders has ,more than doubled from the 2000-2006 period to the 2013-2018 period, from 3.5 percent to nearly 8 percent (Galmiche et al. 2019).
    - More than twelve hundred tons of far were liposuctioned from 1982 to 1992. A recent study showed that only one year after having a liposuction procedure the fat returns, but to a different part of the body. Liposuction is the most frequently performed cosmetic surgery procedure in Western countries (Bellini et al. 2017)." (25)
#### Dieting Can't Transcend Biology
- "Dieting is a form of short-term starvation. Consequently, when you are given the first opportunity to really eat, eating is often experienced at such intensity that it feels uncontrollable, a desperate act...
     While intense eating may feel out of control, and unnatural, it is a normal response to starving and dieting. Yet so often, post-diet eating is viewed as having 'no willpower,' or a character defect. But when you interpret post-diet eating as such, it slowly erodes trust in yourself with food, diet after diet." (25-26)
#### Diet Culture
- "We don't fault you for wanting to lose weight – there is no shame in having this desire. It's completely understandable, because it's a byproduct of our diet culture and a strategy to survive weight stigma." (26)
- "Certified Intuitive Eating Counselor* and host of the popular podcast Food Psych" (26), Christ Harrison, defines diet culture as "a system of beliefs that:
    - Worships thinness and equates it to health and moral virtue...
    - Promotes weight loss as a means of attaining higher status...
    - Demonizes certain ways of eating while elevating others...
    - Oppresses people who don't match up with its supposed picture of 'health,' which disproportionately harms women, femmes, trans folks, people in larger bodies, people of color, and people with disabilities, damaging their mental and physical health." (26-27)
- "The impact of diet culture and weight stigma shows up in life like this...
    - Strangers commenting on your food choices...
    - Exercise is framed as penance for what you eat or are about to eat...
    - Incessant talk of food plans and diet in nearly every social realm... as if it;'s normal.
    - Nonstop dialogue and apologizing for your body and what you are about to eat.
    - People in larger bodies are more dramatically affected by:
        - Inaccessible seating in public spaces and transit
        - Seatbelts on airplanes that don't fit
        - Lack of movement opportunities
        - Medical care withheld (infertility treatments, organ transplants, hip and knee replacement surgeries)" (27)
##### Dieting Increases Your Risk for Weight Cycling
- "A team of UCLA researchers reviewed thirty-one long-term studies on dieting and concluded that dieting is a consistent predictor of weight gain – up to two-thirds of the people regained more weight than they lost (Mann et al. 2007 )." (29)
- "A novel study on more than two thousand sets of twins from Finland, ages sixteen to twenty-five, showed that dieting itself, independent of genetics, is significantly associated with accelerated weight gain (Pietilaineet et al. 2011). A dieting twin who embarked on just one intentional weight loss episode was nearly two to three times more likely to gain more weight, compared to their nondieting twin counterpart. Furthermore, with each dieting episode, the risk of gaining weight increased in a dose-dependent manner." (29)
- "***Weight cycling*** itself is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, inflammation, high blood pressure, and insulin resistance, yet it is seldom controlled for in many large studies that associate weight with health issues (Bacon and Amphamor 2011). Two large studies showed that weight cycling accounts for all the excess mortality that had been linked to body size." (29)
